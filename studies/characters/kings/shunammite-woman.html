      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A wealthy woman of Shunem recognized Elisha as a holy man of God and built a room for him in her home. In return for her hospitality, she received the miraculous gift of a son despite her husband's old age. When the child suddenly died, she persisted in faith, seeking Elisha who raised her son from the dead. Years later, Elisha's warning saved her family from famine, and her property was restored by the king.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The Shunammite woman demonstrates extraordinary hospitality, courageous faith in crisis, and persistent pursuit of God's prophet. Her story illustrates God's power over death and His provision for those who honor His servants, establishing patterns of divine reciprocity and resurrection that anticipate New Testament miracles.</div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Hospitality Extended (2 Kings 4:8–10):</strong>
          Recognizing Elisha as "a holy man of God," she persuades him to eat regularly at her home. With her husband's agreement, she builds a small upper room with bed, table, chair, and lamp - creating a prophet's chamber that becomes a model of sacred hospitality. Her discernment of holiness and provision of space for God's servant establishes her as a woman of spiritual perception and material generosity.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Promise of a Son (2 Kings 4:11–17):</strong>
          When Elisha offers to speak to the king or army commander on her behalf, she declines, content with her life among her people. Gehazi observes she has no son and her husband is old. Despite her initial skepticism ("No, my lord, O man of God; do not lie to your servant"), she conceives and bears a son at the appointed time, receiving what she had not dared to request.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Crisis and Determined Faith (2 Kings 4:18–31):</strong>
          When her son dies suddenly from apparent sunstroke, she lays him on Elisha's bed and sets out immediately for Mount Carmel. Her responses reveal remarkable faith: "It is well" (שָׁלוֹם) to both husband and Gehazi, while privately she clings to Elisha's feet, refusing to leave without him. Her lament is controlled but pointed: "Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, 'Do not deceive me'?"
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Resurrection Miracle (2 Kings 4:32–37):</strong>
          Elisha's staff through Gehazi fails, but the prophet himself stretches upon the child twice, warming the body and restoring life. The woman falls at Elisha's feet in gratitude, then takes up her son - the narrative emphasizing her dignified silence throughout the miracle.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Protection and Restoration (2 Kings 8:1–6):</strong>
          Following Elisha's warning of a seven-year famine, she sojourns in Philistia. Upon return, she appeals to the king for her property just as Gehazi is recounting her story. The king not only restores her land but all its produce from the seven years - divine providence orchestrating perfect timing.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The Shunammite woman's story echoes the widow of Zarephath with Elijah (1 Kings 17), establishing a pattern of prophetic provision through feminine hospitality. Her journey from benefactor to bereaved to restored anticipates the movement from death to resurrection central to biblical hope.</div>

        <h4>Literary Significance</h4>
        <p>The structure centers on the woman's physical grasp of Elisha's feet - a moment of raw faith refusing to let go. This pivot point transforms polite "shalom" into honest lament, passive waiting into active pursuit, and ultimately death into life. The chiasm emphasizes that resurrection comes through persistent, even desperate, faith that literally holds onto God's prophet.</p>

          <strong>Resurrection Preview:</strong>
          The raising of the Shunammite's son anticipates Jesus' resurrection miracles, particularly the widow of Nain's son (Luke 7:11-17) and Jairus's daughter (Mark 5:35-43). The pattern of prophetic power over death points toward Christ's ultimate victory.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Hospitality Rewarded:</strong>
          Her hospitality to God's servant anticipates Jesus' teaching: "Whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward" (Matthew 10:41). Her story embodies this principle.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Faith's Persistence:</strong>
          Her refusal to leave without Elisha prefigures the Syrophoenician woman's persistence with Jesus (Mark 7:24-30) - faith that won't take no for an answer when seeking life for a child.

        <div class="citation-note">
          <p><strong>Note on Sources:</strong></p>
          <p>This bibliography emphasizes sources that explore the Shunammite woman's faith journey and the theological significance of hospitality and resurrection in the Elisha cycle. Special attention is given to works examining the literary artistry of the narrative and its place within the broader prophetic tradition.</p>

          <p><strong>Textual Note:</strong></p>
          <p>The woman remains unnamed throughout the narrative, identified only by her place of origin (Shunem). This anonymity may emphasize her representative role as a model of faith and hospitality rather than individual identity.</p>
