    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Recognizing Holiness (2 Kings 4:8-10):</strong>
          She perceives Elisha as a "holy man of God" and convinces her husband to build a prophet's chamber—a permanent room with bed, table, stool, and lampstand—demonstrating exceptional hospitality and spiritual discernment.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Promise of a Son (2 Kings 4:11-17):</strong>
          When Elisha offers to speak to the king or army commander on her behalf, she declines, content with her life. Elisha promises her a son, which she initially resists, fearing false hope: "No, my lord, do not lie to your servant."
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Crisis of Death (2 Kings 4:18-28):</strong>
          Years later, her son dies suddenly of apparent sunstroke. She lays him on Elisha's bed and travels urgently to Mount Carmel, expressing both faith and anguish: "Did I ask you for a son, my lord?"
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Resurrection Faith (2 Kings 4:29-37):</strong>
          She refuses to leave without Elisha, demonstrating tenacious faith. After Gehazi's failed attempt, Elisha raises the boy, and she falls at his feet in silent gratitude before taking her son.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Famine and Restoration (2 Kings 8:1-6):</strong>
          Following Elisha's warning, she sojourns in Philistia during a seven-year famine. Upon return, while appealing to the king for her property, Gehazi is recounting her story, leading to full restoration of her land and produce.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Her story follows the pattern of barrenness-promise-fulfillment-crisis-restoration seen throughout Scripture, from Sarah to Hannah to Elizabeth.
