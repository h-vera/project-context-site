      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Watchmen of the City appear twice in the Song of Songs during the beloved woman's nocturnal searches for her lover. Anonymous male figures responsible for guarding the city at night, they embody the tension between protection and oppression. Their dramatic shift from neutral observers (3:3) to violent aggressors (5:7) highlights the precarious nature of love in a patriarchal world and the vulnerability of women seeking agency in public spaces.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The Watchmen represent the ambiguity of human authority structures—intended for protection yet capable of violence. Their presence in love's narrative warns that authentic love faces opposition from societal powers that seek to control and confine, particularly female agency and desire. They embody the world's hostility to vulnerable love.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>First Encounter - Neutral Inquiry (Song 3:3):</strong>
          "The watchmen found me as they went about in the city. 'Have you seen him whom my soul loves?'" The woman questions them during her night search, but they offer no response. She quickly passes by them and finds her beloved shortly after, suggesting their irrelevance to love's true quest.</div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Between Encounters - Growing Tension:</strong>
          The shift between the two encounters suggests an escalation in the narrative tension. What begins as a neutral meeting becomes violent confrontation, possibly reflecting the woman's increased vulnerability or the watchmen's growing hostility to her nocturnal agency.</div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Second Encounter - Violence and Humiliation (Song 5:7):</strong>
          "The watchmen found me as they went about in the city; they beat me, they bruised me, they took away my veil, those watchmen of the walls." This time they assault her physically and strip her veil—a profound act of public shaming and violation of her dignity.</div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Aftermath - Silence:</strong>
          After their violent act, the watchmen disappear from the narrative. The woman continues her search through dialogue with the daughters of Jerusalem, suggesting that violence cannot ultimately stop love's pursuit.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The watchmen appear only during night searches, marking the danger of seeking love outside socially sanctioned boundaries. Their escalating response—from silence to violence—mirrors society's increasing hostility toward uncontrolled female desire.</div>
    </div>

        <strong>Redemption Through Crisis:</strong>
        Despite the watchmen's violence, the woman's love persists, and she ultimately reunites with her beloved. Their violence cannot destroy love's power. The narrative suggests that true love transcends and outlasts the violence of fallen authority structures.</div>

          <p><strong>Note on Sources:</strong></p>
          <p>This bibliography emphasizes sources that address the watchmen's role as representatives of patriarchal authority and their violence against the female protagonist. Given their brief but significant appearances, interpretive and thematic analyses are prioritized.</p>
