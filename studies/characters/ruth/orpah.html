      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
        Orpah is one of two Moabite daughters-in-law who initially accompany Naomi on the journey back to Judah. After Naomi's threefold urging to return to Moab, Orpah—with tears and a farewell kiss—turns back to her people and gods. Her departure is not condemned but serves as narrative contrast to highlight Ruth's extraordinary covenant commitment. Orpah represents the reasonable, expected choice; Ruth represents radical, covenant-transforming loyalty.
      </p>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Orpah functions as a literary foil, not a moral failure. Her choice underscores Ruth's remarkable decision by showing what a "normal," culturally appropriate response would look like. The narrative invites readers to see both the validity of Orpah's choice and the extraordinary nature of Ruth's.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Marriage to Chilion (Ruth 1:4):</strong> 
          Orpah marries Chilion ("Done-For"), one of Naomi's sons, during the family's sojourn in Moab. She lives with the Israelite family for about ten years, suggesting genuine integration and relationship.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Widowhood (Ruth 1:5):</strong> 
          Both Mahlon and Chilion die, leaving Orpah and Ruth as young widows with their mother-in-law Naomi. All three women face destitution without male protectors in the ancient world.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Initial Departure with Naomi (Ruth 1:7):</strong> 
          When Naomi decides to return to Judah, both Orpah and Ruth set out with her. Their willingness to leave Moab demonstrates genuine affection and loyalty to Naomi.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>First Urging & Refusal (Ruth 1:8–10):</strong> 
          Naomi blesses both daughters-in-law and urges them to return to their mothers' houses. Both women weep and initially refuse, declaring, "No, we will return with you to your people."
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Second Urging & Orpah's Decision (Ruth 1:11–14):</strong> 
          After Naomi's second, more forceful argument—emphasizing she has no more sons to offer and that the Lord's hand has gone against her—Orpah kisses Naomi goodbye and returns to Moab. Ruth clings (דָּבַק, dābaq) to Naomi.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Naomi's Reference (Ruth 1:15):</strong> 
          Naomi points to Orpah's departure as the expected norm: "See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law." This is Orpah's final mention in Scripture.
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Orpah's journey follows the pattern of initial loyalty → tested commitment → reasonable withdrawal. She does not abandon Naomi callously but responds to Naomi's insistent urging with tearful obedience. Her departure is framed as returning to security, not as failure.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: LITERARY CONTEXT & STRUCTURE -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="literary-context">
      <h3>Literary Context & Structure</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-4">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📚 Position in Book</h4>
          <p>Orpah appears only in chapter 1, functioning as setup for Ruth's extraordinary vow. Her exit creates the dramatic tension that Ruth's choice must resolve.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Literary Patterns</h4>
          <p>The three-fold urging pattern (common in Hebrew narrative) creates escalating pressure. Orpah yields on the second; Ruth requires a third. Name symbolism (עֹרֶף = "back/neck") anticipates turning away.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🎭 Character Function</h4>
          <p>Classic literary foil: by showing what the expected choice looks like, Orpah makes Ruth's radical loyalty visible. Neither character is morally judged; they represent different responses to the same crisis.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>✍️ Narrative Techniques</h4>
          <p>Parallel structure (both weep, both refuse, then diverge) highlights the moment of separation. The kiss/cling contrast (נָשַׁק vs. דָּבַק) dramatizes their different paths.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="word-study">
        <h4>The Kiss/Cling Contrast</h4>
        <p><strong>Orpah:</strong> <span class="hebrew-inline">וַתִּשַּׁק עָרְפָּה לַחֲמוֹתָהּ</span> (wattīššaq ʿorpâ laḥămôtāh) — "Orpah kissed her mother-in-law"</p>
        <p><strong>Ruth:</strong> <span class="hebrew-inline">וְרוּת דָּבְקָה בָּהּ</span> (wĕrût dābĕqâ bāh) — "Ruth clung to her"</p>
        <p>The verb דָּבַק (dābaq, "cling") is the same word used for marriage in Genesis 2:24 ("a man shall leave his father and mother and cling to his wife"). Ruth's attachment to Naomi carries covenant-marriage intensity.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 4: THEOLOGICAL THEMES -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="themes">
      <h3>Major Theological Themes</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div>
          <h4>🌱 Human Choice & Providence</h4>
          <p>Orpah's departure and Ruth's remaining both occur within God's providential plan. Human decisions matter, yet neither is explicitly condemned or praised by the narrator.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Cultural Expectation vs. Covenant Loyalty</h4>
          <p>Orpah represents the culturally sensible choice—returning to family, security, and familiar gods. Ruth's choice subverts cultural norms for covenant loyalty.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>💡 The Nature of Ḥesed</h4>
          <p>Naomi acknowledges that both women have shown ḥesed (loyal love) to the dead and to her (1:8). Orpah's departure doesn't negate her prior faithfulness.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🔥 Gods & Allegiance</h4>
          <p>Naomi's words—"back to her people and to her gods" (1:15)—frame the choice as ultimately about divine allegiance. Ruth chooses Yahweh; Orpah returns to Moab's gods.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🕊️ Reasonable Faith vs. Radical Faith</h4>
          <p>Orpah's faith and loyalty were genuine but limited by circumstance. Ruth's faith breaks through reasonable limits into radical, unexplainable commitment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>👑 Narrative Necessity</h4>
          <p>Without Orpah's departure, Ruth's choice would have no dramatic weight. The story requires someone to make the expected choice so that the unexpected can shine.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 5: BIBLICAL THEOLOGY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="biblical-theology">
      <h3>Creation, Fall & Redemption Patterns</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🌍 The Two-Path Motif</h4>
          <p>Scripture repeatedly presents two paths (life/death, blessing/curse, wisdom/folly). Orpah and Ruth embody this pattern, though without the stark moral judgment typical of such contrasts. This invites nuanced reading rather than simple condemnation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🍎 Return to the Familiar</h4>
          <p>Orpah's return to Moab echoes other biblical "returns"—Israel's longing for Egypt, Lot's wife looking back. Yet Orpah is not punished; her choice represents the gravitational pull of origin and security that makes Ruth's forward movement remarkable.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Compassionate Reading:</strong> 
        Later Jewish tradition (midrash) sometimes vilifies Orpah, even making her an ancestor of Goliath. But the biblical text itself offers no such condemnation. A canonical reading honors both Orpah's genuine grief and Ruth's extraordinary choice, recognizing that not everyone can make the radical leap—and that's not necessarily failure.
      </div>
    </div>

        <strong>Contemporary Challenge:</strong> Our culture often demands we judge every choice as hero or villain. Orpah invites us into a more complex reading where someone can make a reasonable, understandable choice that is not wrong, yet still not be the one through whom God's redemptive story advances. Not everyone is called to Ruth's path—but Ruth's path would be invisible without Orpah's.
