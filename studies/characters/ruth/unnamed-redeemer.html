      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
        Peloni Almoni is one of Scripture's most theologically significant unnamed characters. He holds the legal right of first refusal as the closer kinsman-redeemer for Elimelech's property. When Boaz presents the case at the city gate, Peloni Almoni initially agrees to redeem the land—until he learns that redemption includes marrying "Ruth the Moabite" to preserve the family line. At this, he withdraws: "I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance." His concern for self-preservation costs him his name: the narrator deliberately refuses to record it, leaving him forever as "So-and-so." In contrast, Ruth the foreigner—whom he refused—becomes an ancestor of David and is remembered eternally.
      </p>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The deliberate anonymity of this character is the narrator's judgment upon him. While Boaz, Ruth, and even Obed are named and remembered, the man who protected his own inheritance at the expense of caring for the foreigner is forgotten. This unnamed status is not accidental—it is narrative punishment. His namelessness directly connects to his refusal to participate in preserving Mahlon's name (4:10). He who would not preserve another's name loses his own.

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Scene</h3>
      
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Boaz's Strategic Setup (Ruth 4:1-2):</strong> 
          Boaz positions himself at the city gate—the ancient world's courthouse. When Peloni Almoni passes by ("And behold!"—הִנֵּה, another "coincidence"), Boaz calls him aside. Notably, Boaz addresses him as <span class="hebrew">פְּלֹנִי אַלְמֹנִי</span>—either a deliberate snub or the narrator's retrospective erasure. Boaz also assembles ten elders as witnesses before the man even sits down.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Land Offer (4:3-4):</strong> 
          Boaz presents the case: "Naomi...is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech. So I thought I would tell you of it...If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you will not, tell me." Peloni Almoni responds enthusiastically: <strong>"I will redeem it."</strong> Land acquisition without complication? An excellent investment.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Catch Revealed (4:5):</strong> 
          Boaz springs his trap: "The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead on his inheritance." The land comes with a foreign widow attached—and any children would not be "his" but would carry Mahlon's name and inherit the property.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Refusal (4:6):</strong> 
          <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #e11d48; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
            "Then the redeemer said, 'I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem.'"
          </blockquote>
          <p>His calculus is clear: children through Ruth would inherit the land, leaving his existing family with less. Self-interest trumps covenant obligation. He protects his inheritance at the cost of his legacy.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Sandal Ceremony (4:7-8):</strong> 
          He removes his sandal and gives it to Boaz—a legal act confirming the transfer of redemption rights. The narrator pauses to explain this custom, suggesting distance from the original audience. The ceremony publicly confirms his forfeiture.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: LITERARY CONTEXT -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="literary-context">
      <h3>Literary Context & Function</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-4">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🎭 Narrative Foil</h4>
          <p>Peloni Almoni exists primarily to highlight Boaz's generosity. Where Boaz exceeds obligation, this man does minimum. Where Boaz embraces Ruth, this man rejects her. His refusal makes Boaz's acceptance shine brighter.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📚 Plot Function</h4>
          <p>He creates necessary tension: Will redemption happen? His existence shows redemption is not automatic—it requires a willing redeemer. The legal obstacle makes Boaz's eventual redemption more dramatic.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>✍️ Deliberate Anonymity</h4>
          <p>The narrator's refusal to name him is interpretive. In a book where names carry theological weight (Naomi/Mara, Mahlon, Obed), namelessness is narrative judgment. He becomes a warning: refuse ḥesed, lose your legacy.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Public Shaming</h4>
          <p>The sandal ceremony may echo the "despised" status of one who refuses levirate duty (Deut 25:9-10). While the text doesn't explicitly shame him, his namelessness serves similar function.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="word-study">
        <h4>Understanding <span class="hebrew-large">פְּלֹנִי אַלְמֹנִי</span> (pĕlōnî ʾalmōnî)</h4>
        <p>This expression appears only twice in the Hebrew Bible (Ruth 4:1; 1 Sam 21:3), functioning like English "so-and-so" or "Mr. X." It's used when a speaker either doesn't know a name or deliberately conceals it. Most translations render it "friend" (NASB, ESV) or "my friend" (NIV), but this obscures the Hebrew's deliberate vagueness. The NET's "John Doe" captures the sense better.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Scholarly Debate:</strong> Did Boaz actually call him this, or is the narrator retrospectively erasing his name? Either reading carries theological weight—whether Boaz publicly refused to honor him with his name, or the narrator's tradition judged him unworthy of remembrance.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 4: TORAH FAILURE -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="torah-failure">
      <h3>Torah Failure: Neglecting the Foreigner</h3>
      
      <p>Your insight is sharp: this man's anonymity may connect to his failure to care for the foreigner as Torah commands. The Law repeatedly emphasizes care for the גֵּר (stranger/foreigner):</p>

        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📜 Torah Commands</h4>

            <li><strong>Deut 10:18-19:</strong> "He...loves the stranger, giving them food and clothing. You shall also love the stranger."</li>
            <li><strong>Exod 22:21:</strong> "You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress them."</li>
            <li><strong>Deut 24:17:</strong> "You shall not pervert the justice due a stranger or an orphan."</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>⚖️ His Failure</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Willing to redeem land (economic benefit)</li>
            <li>Unwilling to redeem Ruth (foreign widow = cost)</li>
            <li>"The Moabite" appears to be the stumbling block</li>
            <li>Self-protection overrides covenant obligation</li>

        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern of Judgment:</strong> Throughout Scripture, those who fail to show mercy to the vulnerable often face corresponding judgment. This man refused to preserve Mahlon's name; he loses his own. He refused to include the foreigner; he is excluded from the story's memory. He protected his inheritance; he forfeits his legacy. The irony is complete.

    <!-- SECTION 5: THEOLOGICAL THEMES -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="themes">
      <h3>Major Theological Themes</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Self-Interest vs. Ḥesed</h4>
          <p>His refusal epitomizes choosing self-protection over covenant love. Boaz practices ḥesed that costs him; Peloni Almoni refuses ḥesed that costs him. The contrast defines redemption's heart.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>📜 Name & Legacy</h4>
          <p>The ironic justice: he refused to raise up Mahlon's name; he loses his own. In a culture where one's name was one's legacy, namelessness is the ultimate erasure.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🌍 Insider vs. Outsider</h4>
          <p>The "insider" Israelite who refuses covenant obligation is forgotten; the "outsider" Moabite who embraces covenant love is honored forever. Categories are inverted.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>💰 True vs. False Inheritance</h4>
          <p>He feared "ruining" his inheritance but had no idea what true inheritance meant. Ruth and Boaz's inheritance becomes the Davidic dynasty; his inheritance is unknown.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🚫 Redemption Refused</h4>
          <p>Not everyone accepts the opportunity to participate in God's redemptive work. Some calculate the cost and decline. The redemption story proceeds without them—and forgets them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>👁️ What God Remembers</h4>
          <p>God remembers those who practice ḥesed (Ruth, Boaz, Naomi). Those who choose self-protection over covenant love are not remembered. Memory itself becomes moral judgment.</p>

        <strong>Typological Warning:</strong> Peloni Almoni represents all who calculate the cost of covenant love and find it too expensive. He foreshadows those who hear God's call to redemptive action but decline because of self-interest. His namelessness is a warning: participate in God's redemption or be forgotten.

        <strong>Contemporary Warning:</strong> Peloni Almoni is disturbingly relatable. He wasn't evil—he was pragmatic. He wasn't cruel—he was careful. He simply did the math and decided covenant love cost too much. His tragedy is that reasonable self-interest cost him his place in the greatest story of redemption. The question lingers: How often do we make the same calculation?
