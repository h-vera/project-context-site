    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="overview">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <div class="meta">
        <div class="kv"><strong>Scripture:</strong> Ruth 4:2, 9-12</div>
        <div class="kv"><strong>Hebrew:</strong> <span class="hebrew">זְקֵנִים</span> (zĕqēnîm) = "elders"; <span class="hebrew">שַׁעַר</span> (šaʿar) = "gate"</div>

      </p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
        The elders at the gate represent Bethlehem's judicial and civic authority. Boaz deliberately assembles ten of them before the closer kinsman even arrives, demonstrating his intention to conduct formal legal proceedings. They serve as official witnesses to the transfer of redemption rights and the marriage agreement. But their role transcends mere legal function: they pronounce a remarkable blessing over Ruth and Boaz, comparing Ruth to Rachel and Leah (who "built the house of Israel") and invoking the precedent of Tamar and Judah. Their blessing is essentially prophetic—they speak messianic hope over a Moabite widow without fully knowing they are blessing the great-grandmother of David.
      </p>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The elders function as official Israel validating Ruth's full inclusion. Their blessing places her alongside Israel's founding mothers and invokes Perez (from whom Boaz descends). In a book where a Moabite's acceptance was uncertain, the elders' formal blessing represents the community's authoritative embrace. They are the male counterpart to the women's chorus—where the women interpret and celebrate, the elders validate and bless.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Appearances</h3>
      
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Strategic Assembly (Ruth 4:2):</strong> 
          "And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, 'Sit down here.' So they sat down." Boaz assembles the elders before the closer kinsman arrives. The number ten represents official quorum—enough witnesses to constitute binding legal testimony. Boaz is preparing a trap, and the elders are essential to its legitimacy.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Witness to Transaction (4:9):</strong> 
          "Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, 'You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and to Mahlon.'" Boaz formally declares his redemption before them, establishing legal record. Their presence makes the transaction binding and irrevocable.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Marriage Declaration (4:10):</strong> 
          "Also Ruth the Moabite, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his native place. You are witnesses this day." The elders witness Ruth's formal inclusion—she is now legally bound to Israel.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Witness Confirmation (4:11a):</strong> 
          "Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, 'We are witnesses.'" This formal response completes the legal requirements. The transaction is now official, public, and permanent.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Prophetic Blessing (4:11b-12):</strong> 
          The elders move from legal witness to prophetic blessing—their words become the book's climactic declaration of hope, connecting Ruth to Israel's founding mothers and messianic future.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: LITERARY CONTEXT -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="literary-context">
      <h3>Literary Context & Function</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-4">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>⚖️ Legal Function</h4>
          <p>The gate was ancient Israel's courthouse. Elders served as judges and witnesses for property transfers, marriages, disputes, and contracts. Their presence made transactions legally binding.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Parallel to Women's Chorus</h4>
          <p>As the women of Bethlehem interpret God's work in chapter 4's conclusion, so the elders validate and bless in chapter 4's middle. Together they represent the full community—male and female—affirming Ruth's redemption.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📜 Canonical Memory</h4>
          <p>Their blessing invokes Rachel, Leah, Tamar, and Perez—connecting this moment to Israel's foundational stories. They serve as living links between past and future, tradition and hope.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>✍️ Prophetic Voice</h4>
          <p>Their blessing exceeds their knowledge. They speak of fame in Ephrathah and Bethlehem without knowing Obed, Jesse, or David are coming. Their words become unintentionally prophetic.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Why Ten?</strong> The number ten appears throughout Scripture as the number of completeness for legal assembly: ten spies (Num 13), ten men to constitute a congregation (later rabbinic minyan), and Abraham's bargaining stopping at ten righteous in Sodom. Boaz ensures maximum legal weight for his actions.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 4: THE BLESSING -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="blessing">
      <h3>The Elders' Blessing: A Closer Look</h3>
      
      <div class="key-verse" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #faf5ff 0%, #fef3f2 100%); padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #7209b7; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          "May the LORD make the woman, who is coming into your house, like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you act worthily in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem, and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring that the LORD will give you by this young woman."
        </p>
        <span style="display: block; text-align: right; font-weight: bold; color: #7209b7;">— Ruth 4:11b-12</span>
      </div>
      
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📖 Rachel and Leah Reference</h4>
          <p>"Who together built the house of Israel"—the elders compare Ruth to the matriarchs whose twelve sons became the twelve tribes. This is extraordinary: a Moabite widow is placed alongside the founding mothers of the nation. The verb "built" (בָּנָה) puns on "sons" (בָּנִים)—they built Israel through their offspring.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📖 Ephrathah and Bethlehem</h4>
          <p>Ephrathah is Bethlehem's ancient/poetic name (Gen 35:19; Micah 5:2). The elders invoke the place's dignity and destiny. Micah will later prophesy that from Bethlehem Ephrathah will come a ruler over Israel. The elders unknowingly bless the town's messianic future.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📖 Tamar and Judah Reference</h4>
          <p>This explicit parallel is remarkable. Tamar was a Canaanite woman who, like Ruth, preserved a family line through bold action when men failed. Perez, born from that union, is Boaz's own ancestor. The elders acknowledge that God works through "irregular" circumstances and foreign women.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📖 "Offspring the LORD Will Give"</h4>
          <p>They invoke divine blessing on future children. This anticipates God's direct action in 4:13 ("the LORD enabled her to conceive") and looks forward to Obed, Jesse, and David. Their blessing is prophetic in ways they cannot imagine.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Unintentional Prophecy:</strong> The elders bless Ruth and Boaz to have fame in Bethlehem and offspring like Perez's house. They have no idea they are blessing the great-grandparents of David, whose name will bring Bethlehem eternal fame, and whose line will produce the Messiah. Their words exceed their understanding—a pattern throughout Scripture where human blessing aligns with divine intention.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 5: THEOLOGICAL THEMES -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="themes">
      <h3>Major Theological Themes</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Community Validation</h4>
          <p>The elders represent Israel's official acceptance of Ruth. Their witness and blessing mean her inclusion is not informal or provisional—it is legally, publicly, and covenantally complete.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>📜 Canonical Continuity</h4>
          <p>By invoking Rachel, Leah, and Tamar, the elders place Ruth's story within Israel's ongoing narrative. She becomes part of the pattern of how God builds his people—often through unexpected women.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🗣️ Prophetic Blessing</h4>
          <p>Their blessing becomes prophetic. Speaking greater truth than they know, they anticipate the Davidic line without knowing David's name. Human blessing aligned with divine purpose carries power.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🤝 Corporate Responsibility</h4>
          <p>The elders model community responsibility for covenant relationships. Marriages, redemptions, and family matters are not private—they require community witness, blessing, and accountability.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🌍 Gentile Full Inclusion</h4>
          <p>The elders' enthusiastic blessing of "this woman who is coming into your house" shows no hesitation about Ruth's Moabite origin. Official Israel embraces her completely.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>📖 Memory and Precedent</h4>
          <p>By citing Tamar and Perez, the elders show they understand history theologically. Past precedents illuminate present situations. They interpret Ruth's story through Israel's story.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 6: BIBLICAL THEOLOGY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="biblical-theology">
      <h3>Biblical Theology: Witnesses to Redemption</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📖 OT Context</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Deut 17:6-7:</strong> Two or three witnesses required for legal matters—ten provides abundant witness</li>
            <li><strong>Deut 25:7-10:</strong> Elders at the gate adjudicate levirate refusals</li>
            <li><strong>Prov 31:23:</strong> "Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders"</li>
            <li><strong>Job 29:7-17:</strong> Job's description of gate-sitting as judicial service</li>
            <li><strong>Amos 5:15:</strong> "Establish justice in the gate"</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>✨ NT Fulfillment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Matt 18:16:</strong> Jesus cites two-three witnesses principle</li>
            <li><strong>Heb 12:1:</strong> "Great cloud of witnesses"—community testimony</li>
            <li><strong>1 Tim 5:19:</strong> Charges against elders need witnesses</li>
            <li><strong>Rev 4:4:</strong> Twenty-four elders around the throne—witnessing and worshiping</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern of Witness:</strong> Throughout Scripture, significant covenantal moments require witnesses. The elders at Bethlehem's gate join the cloud of witnesses who testify to God's redemptive work—from Sinai's elders who saw God's glory to Revelation's elders who worship the Lamb. They model the church's calling: to witness, validate, and bless what God is doing.

Their enthusiastic blessing of Ruth challenges any community that hesitates to fully embrace the outsider God is bringing in.
