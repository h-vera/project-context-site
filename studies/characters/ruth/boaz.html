      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Boaz, a wealthy and righteous landowner in Bethlehem, exemplifies covenant faithfulness through his role as kinsman-redeemer for Naomi and Ruth. His integrity in following Torah commands regarding the poor and his willingness to marry Ruth the Moabite establish him as a model of חֶסֶד (loyal love). Through his union with Ruth, he becomes the great-grandfather of King David, placing him in the messianic lineage.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Boaz embodies God's redemptive character, demonstrating how divine providence works through human faithfulness. His inclusion of Ruth the Moabite anticipates the gospel's embrace of all nations, while his role as גֹּאֵל prefigures Christ as humanity's ultimate Redeemer.</div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Introduction as Man of Substance (Ruth 2:1):</strong>
          Boaz is introduced as a גִּבּוֹר חַיִל (gibbōr ḥayil), "mighty man of wealth/valor," from Elimelech's clan. This establishes him as both prosperous and of noble character, positioned to be God's instrument of redemption.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Providential Meeting with Ruth (Ruth 2:5–16):</strong>
          Boaz notices Ruth gleaning in his fields and shows extraordinary kindness, ensuring her protection and provision. He recognizes her חֶסֶד toward Naomi and invokes Yahweh's blessing, praying she find refuge under God's "wings" (כָּנָף).
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Threshing Floor Encounter (Ruth 3:7–15):</strong>
          When Ruth appeals to Boaz as redeemer at the threshing floor, asking him to spread his כָּנָף (wing/garment edge) over her, Boaz praises her loyalty. He promises to act but reveals a nearer kinsman exists, demonstrating legal integrity even in a potentially compromising situation.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Redemption at the City Gate (Ruth 4:1–12):</strong>
          Boaz cleverly negotiates with the nearer kinsman (פְּלֹנִי אַלְמֹנִי, "so-and-so"), who declines when learning redemption includes marrying Ruth the Moabite. Boaz publicly acquires Elimelech's land and Ruth as wife, with the elders blessing him to build up Israel like Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Father of Obed, Grandfather of Jesse (Ruth 4:13–22):</strong>
          Through his marriage to Ruth, Boaz fathers Obed, who becomes the grandfather of King David. The book concludes with this genealogy, revealing how ordinary faithfulness participates in God's messianic purposes.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Boaz consistently responds to need with abundance, mirroring God's generous character. His journey from noticing Ruth to redeeming her follows a pattern of recognition → protection → commitment → redemption, embodying divine חֶסֶד through human action.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: LITERARY CONTEXT -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="literary-context">
      <h3>Literary Context & Structure</h3>
      <div class="grid-4">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📚 Position in Book</h4>
          <p>Boaz appears in chapters 2–4, absent from the tragedy of chapter 1 but central to the restoration. His late entrance emphasizes God's providential timing in redemption.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Literary Patterns</h4>
          <p>Parallels with Ruth as אֵשֶׁת חַיִל (3:11) to his גִּבּוֹר חַיִל (2:1). The כָּנָף wordplay (2:12 → 3:9) links divine and human refuge. His actions mirror Abraham's hospitality and Judah's eventual righteousness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🎭 Character Function</h4>
          <p>Boaz serves as the human agent of divine redemption, the righteous Israelite who recognizes true faith in a Moabite, and the legal means through which Naomi's emptiness becomes fullness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>✍️ Narrative Techniques</h4>
          <p>The narrator uses dialogue to reveal Boaz's character, legal precision to show his integrity, and genealogy to unveil his ultimate significance. His nameless rival (4:1) highlights Boaz's memorable faithfulness.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        <strong>Abrahamic Echo:</strong> When Boaz commends Ruth for leaving "your father, mother, and land of your מוֹלֶדֶת (mōledet, birthplace)" (2:11), he directly echoes God's call to Abraham in Genesis 12:1. This deliberate parallel frames Ruth's loyalty as covenant faith and Boaz's recognition as prophetic insight into God's inclusive purposes.

        <h4>Literary Significance</h4>
        <p>The chiastic structure centers on the threshing floor encounter, where divine providence and human initiative converge. The movement from temporary provision (gleaning) to permanent redemption (marriage) mirrors the larger biblical narrative of God's redemptive plan. Boaz's transformation from observer to redeemer parallels how God moves from watching over his people to actively redeeming them.</p>

        <div>
          <h4>🌍 Eden Echoes / Creation Themes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Boaz as "new Adam" providing for and protecting Ruth in the "garden" of his fields</li>
            <li>Restoration of fruitfulness after famine (creation blessing renewed)</li>

            <li>The "craftiness" (עָרוּם) feared at the grain heap (עֲרֵמָה, 3:7) yields to righteousness</li>
            <li>Death and barrenness in chapter 1 reversed through redemption</li>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Redemption Through Ordinary Faithfulness:</strong>
        God works redemption not through miraculous intervention but through Boaz's integrity, Ruth's loyalty, and Naomi's wisdom. The story demonstrates how human faithfulness becomes the vehicle for divine restoration, with Boaz's wings becoming Yahweh's wings of refuge.

      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Kinsman-Redeemer Typology:</strong>
          Boaz as גֹּאֵל prefigures Christ who redeems humanity. Like Boaz who had the right, resources, and willingness to redeem, Jesus possesses all three qualifications to redeem humanity from sin and death.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Inclusive Redemption:</strong>
          Boaz's marriage to Ruth the Moabite anticipates Christ's breaking down of the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile (Ephesians 2:14), showing God's redemptive plan always included all nations.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Davidic Lineage Established:</strong>
          Through Obed, Boaz becomes David's great-grandfather, establishing the royal line from which the Messiah comes. Matthew 1:5 explicitly names Boaz and Ruth in Jesus's genealogy.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Costly Grace:</strong>
          Boaz's redemption costs him resources and reputation (marrying a Moabite), prefiguring Christ's costly redemption that required his life as ransom (Mark 10:45).

        <strong>Contemporary Challenge:</strong> Boaz challenges modern individualism by taking costly responsibility for others' wellbeing. His story asks: Will we be kinsman-redeemers who spread our wings of protection over the vulnerable, or will we, like "So-and-so," protect our own interests?

        <li>How does Boaz's acceptance of Ruth the Moabite challenge both ancient and modern boundaries of inclusion?</li>
        <li>In what ways does the Boaz-Ruth story reverse and redeem the Judah-Tamar narrative?</li>
        <li>How does Boaz's role as גֹּאֵל (kinsman-redeemer) illuminate Christ's redemptive work?</li>
        <li>What does the contrast between Boaz and "So-and-so" (פְּלֹנִי אַלְמֹנִי) teach about the cost of redemption?</li>
        <li>How might the story's movement from famine to harvest, emptiness to fullness, speak to experiences of loss and restoration today?</li>
        <li>What does Boaz's careful legal process at the city gate teach about the relationship between love and law, grace and justice?</li>

          <p>This bibliography focuses on sources that illuminate Boaz's character, his role as kinsman-redeemer, and the book's redemptive theology. Special attention has been given to works exploring the חֶסֶד theme, the chiastic structure of Ruth, and the messianic trajectory through the Davidic line.</p>
