      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
        Elimelech, Mahlon, and Chilion form a literary unit representing "what was lost" in the book of Ruth. They appear only in the opening five verses, never speak a single word, and all die in Moab. Their departure from Bethlehem ("House of Bread") during famine represents a reverse-exodus—moving away from the Promised Land toward death in foreign territory. Their symbolic names foreshadow their fate: while the father's name proclaims "My God is King," his sons bear names meaning "Sickness" and "Wasting Away." Their deaths create the narrative problem (loss of identity, relationships, land, future) that the rest of the story must resolve through redemption.
      </p>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> These men embody the anti-pattern of biblical faith. While Abraham, Jacob, and Israel move toward the Promised Land, Elimelech's family moves away from it. While the Exodus moves God's people from slavery toward life, this family moves from the land of promise toward death. Their eastward journey echoes Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden, Cain's wandering, and Lot's disastrous choice of Sodom. They represent Israel during the Judges period—abandoning covenant faithfulness and suffering the consequences.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Departure from Bethlehem (Ruth 1:1-2):</strong> 
          "In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land." Elimelech takes his wife Naomi and sons Mahlon and Chilion from Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn in Moab. This opening frames their departure as occurring during Israel's darkest era—when "everyone did what was right in their own eyes" (Judges 21:25).
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Death of Elimelech (1:3):</strong> 
          "Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons." The father dies first, leaving his family without male protection in a foreign land. His death is stated without explanation, commentary, or mourning—just stark narrative fact.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Marriage to Moabite Women (1:4):</strong> 
          "These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth." The sons marry foreign women—a detail that would have raised immediate concern for ancient Israelite readers given the Torah's warnings about Moabite associations (Num 25; Deut 23:3-6).
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Death of Sons (1:5):</strong> 
          "And both Mahlon and Chilion died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband." After about ten years in Moab, both sons die—their names proving prophetic. Their deaths complete the family's destruction and leave three widows utterly vulnerable.
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The deaths occur in rapid succession within the narrative: father → (time) → both sons. This accelerating loss creates the "emptiness" Naomi laments (1:21). Their collective demise sets up everything the rest of the story must restore: husband, sons, land, lineage, and hope.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: LITERARY CONTEXT -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="literary-context">
      <h3>Literary Context & Function</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-4">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📚 Narrative Function</h4>
          <p>These three men exist to die. Their deaths within the first five verses create the narrative problem that drives the entire plot. They are the "what was lost" that must be redeemed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Anti-Exodus Pattern</h4>
          <p>While Israel's story moves toward the Promised Land, this family moves away from it. Their journey reverses the Exodus pattern: instead of leaving slavery for life, they leave the land of promise for death.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🎭 Symbolic Silence</h4>
          <p>None of these men speak a single word in the narrative. Their silence contrasts sharply with the powerful speeches of Ruth and Naomi, highlighting their role as passive victims rather than active agents.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>✍️ Foreshadowing Names</h4>
          <p>The sons' names—Sick-O and Done-For—telegraph their fate. The narrator uses this heavy-handed symbolism to signal that their deaths are part of the theological message, not mere plot points.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Why Combine These Characters?</strong> These three function as a single literary unit. They all leave, they all die, none speaks, and together they represent the complete loss that creates the narrative crisis. Separating them would artificially inflate minor characters who exist only to establish the problem that redemption addresses.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 4: NAME SYMBOLISM -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="name-symbolism">
      <h3>Hebrew Name Symbolism</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div class="word-study">
          <h4><span class="hebrew-large">אֱלִימֶלֶךְ</span></h4>
          <p><strong>Elimelech: "My God is King"</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Etymology:</strong> From אֵל (ʾēl, "God") + מֶלֶךְ (melek, "king")</p>
          <p><strong>Irony:</strong> A man whose name proclaims divine kingship abandons the Promised Land. His name becomes a theological accusation: if "my God is king," why flee to Moab? The famine that drives him away is itself a covenant curse (Deut 28:23-24)—yet he responds by leaving rather than repenting.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="word-study">
          <h4><span class="hebrew-large">מַחְלוֹן</span></h4>
          <p><strong>Mahlon: "Sickness" / "Sick-One"</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Etymology:</strong> From root חלה (ḥlh), "to be sick, weak"</p>
          <p><strong>Function:</strong> Ruth 4:10 identifies Mahlon as Ruth's first husband. His name foreshadows his fate—he lives for only "two sentences" in the narrative before dying. The name may suggest he was sickly from birth, or it may be a retrospective name reflecting his destiny.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="word-study">
          <h4><span class="hebrew-large">כִּלְיוֹן</span></h4>
          <p><strong>Chilion: "Failing" / "Wasting Away"</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Etymology:</strong> From root כלה (klh), "to be complete, finished, consumed"</p>
          <p><strong>Function:</strong> Orpah's husband bears a name meaning "destruction" or "annihilation." Like his brother, he exists in the narrative only to die. His name suggests utter consumption—being used up completely.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Naming:</strong> The contrast between the father's theologically rich name ("My God is King") and the sons' death-laden names ("Sick-O" and "Done-For") may reflect the generational decline during the Judges period. The father still bears a name affirming Yahweh's sovereignty; the sons bear names that speak only of decay and ending. This mirrors Israel's trajectory: the Exodus generation knew God's power, but subsequent generations forgot (Judges 2:10).

    <!-- SECTION 5: THEOLOGICAL THEMES -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="themes">
      <h3>Major Theological Themes</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div>
          <h4>🌍 Reverse Exodus</h4>
          <p>The Exodus moved Israel from slavery toward the Promised Land and life. Elimelech's family moves the opposite direction—from the Promised Land toward foreign territory and death. This anti-pattern shows the spiritual state of Israel during the Judges.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🍎 East of Eden</h4>
          <p>Like Adam expelled from the garden, like Cain wandering east, like Lot choosing Sodom, this family moves eastward toward death. Moab lies east of the Jordan—outside the covenant land, in the direction of exile and judgment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Covenant Curse</h4>
          <p>The famine that triggers their departure is itself a covenant curse (Lev 26:19-20; Deut 28:23-24). Their response—fleeing rather than repenting—compounds the problem. They treat symptoms while ignoring the cause.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>💀 Death Outside the Land</h4>
          <p>All three die in Moab—outside God's covenant territory. This echoes the wilderness generation who died outside Canaan due to unbelief. Dying outside the land suggests dying outside God's blessing.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>📜 Loss of Everything</h4>
          <p>Their deaths strip away every blessing: husband/father, sons/heirs, land (about to be sold), family name (about to be forgotten), and future (no descendants). They embody the "emptiness" Naomi later laments.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🔄 What Redemption Must Address</h4>
          <p>Everything these men represent—land, lineage, name, protection, provision, hope—becomes what redemption must restore. Their deaths define the scope of what the גֹּאֵל (kinsman-redeemer) must accomplish.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 6: BIBLICAL THEOLOGY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="biblical-theology">
      <h3>Biblical Theology: Creation, Fall & Redemption Patterns</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🍎 Fall Patterns (Dominant)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Eastward movement:</strong> Like expulsion from Eden (Gen 3:24)</li>
            <li><strong>Famine as curse:</strong> Land failing to produce (covenant judgment)</li>
            <li><strong>Death in exile:</strong> Like the wilderness generation</li>
            <li><strong>Generational decline:</strong> Father → sons, faith → forgetfulness</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of inheritance:</strong> Land about to leave the family</li>
            <li><strong>Broken relationships:</strong> Widows left vulnerable</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🌱 Redemption Setup</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Creates the crisis:</strong> Without their deaths, no redemption story</li>
            <li><strong>Defines what must be restored:</strong> Land, lineage, name, future</li>
            <li><strong>Sets up Boaz's role:</strong> He will restore what they lost</li>
            <li><strong>Enables Ruth's entrance:</strong> Widowhood opens the door for a Moabite to join Israel</li>
            <li><strong>Points to greater redemption:</strong> Ultimate Redeemer addresses all these losses</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Typological Function:</strong> These men represent what happens when Israel abandons covenant faithfulness. Their trajectory—leaving the land, marrying foreigners, dying in exile—previews what will happen to the nation as a whole. The book of Ruth, set during Judges, anticipates the Exile. But it also shows that even from such comprehensive loss, God can bring redemption through faithful human agency.

        <strong>Contemporary Warning:</strong> Elimelech's family shows that responding to hardship by abandoning community often leads to greater loss. The famine was real, but the solution—leaving the Promised Land—brought only death. Modern believers face similar temptations: when church feels difficult, when faith costs something, when "Moab" offers easier options. The question remains: will we stay and trust, or flee and risk losing everything?
