      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
        Naomi is an Israelite woman from Bethlehem who experiences profound loss—her husband Elimelech and both sons die while in Moab during a famine—leaving her with two Moabite daughters-in-law. Her journey from "pleasantness" to "bitterness" (Mara) and back to fullness becomes the narrative frame for exploring God's hidden providence through ordinary human faithfulness. Through Ruth's loyal love and Boaz's redemptive action, Naomi moves from emptiness to becoming nurse to Obed, grandfather of King David, making her story central to Israel's messianic hope.
      </p>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Naomi's story demonstrates how God works through communal faithfulness to restore the destitute, revealing that divine providence often operates through ordinary acts of loyal love (ḥesed). Her transformation from emptiness to fullness prefigures Israel's own exile and return, while her role in David's lineage places her within the messianic trajectory leading to Christ.

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Famine & Migration to Moab (Ruth 1:1-2):</strong> 
          During the dark period of the judges and a covenant-curse famine, Naomi's family leaves Bethlehem ("house of bread") for Moab. This exile from the promised land sets the stage for loss and eventual restoration.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Triple Bereavement (1:3-5):</strong> 
          Naomi loses her husband Elimelech ("My God is King"), then watches both sons Mahlon ("Sick-O") and Chilion ("Done-For") die after marrying Moabite women. She is left destitute in a foreign land with only her daughters-in-law Orpah and Ruth.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Return & Ruth's Vow (1:6-18):</strong> 
          Hearing that the Lord has provided food in Judah, Naomi begins her return journey. She urges both daughters-in-law to remain in Moab, but Ruth binds herself to Naomi with a covenant vow: "Your people shall be my people, and your God my God" (1:16).
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Arrival & Lament (1:19-22):</strong> 
          Returning to Bethlehem at barley harvest (Passover season), Naomi tells the women to call her "Mara" (Bitter) rather than "Naomi" (Pleasant), lamenting that she went out full but the Lord brought her back empty—a theological protest born of genuine suffering.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Recognition of Providence (2:1-23):</strong> 
          When Ruth "happens" to glean in Boaz's field and returns with abundant grain, Naomi recognizes God's ḥesed (loyal love) has not forsaken the living or the dead. She identifies Boaz as a goel (family redeemer), seeing the first signs of restoration.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Strategic Initiative (3:1-18):</strong> 
          Naomi orchestrates Ruth's nighttime encounter with Boaz at the threshing floor, instructing her to appeal for redemption. This bold plan, echoing Tamar's initiative with Judah, demonstrates faith taking action for family restoration.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Redemption & Restoration (4:1-17):</strong> 
          After Boaz legally redeems the family property and marries Ruth, their son Obed is born. The women of Bethlehem declare Naomi's redeemer has not failed her, and she becomes nurse to the child who will be grandfather to King David—her emptiness transformed to fullness.
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Naomi's arc follows the classic biblical pattern of fullness → emptiness → restoration, mirroring Israel's exile and return narrative. Her story demonstrates that lament and hope can coexist, and that God's redemption often comes through the faithfulness of community members.

        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📚 Position in Book</h4>
          <p>Naomi frames the entire narrative—her plight opens the story and her restoration closes it. She is the true protagonist whose emptiness creates the narrative problem that Ruth and Boaz solve.</p>

        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Literary Patterns</h4>
          <p>Name transformation (Naomi↔Mara) marks the narrative turning point. Her speeches create an inclusio: lament in ch.1, blessing in ch.4. The women's chorus provides interpretive commentary on her journey.</p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Preservation of Davidic Line:</strong>
          Naomi's restoration directly leads to David's birth—without her story, no David, no messianic lineage through him.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Redemption Pattern:</strong>
          The goel (Boaz) who redeems the destitute widow prefigures Christ as ultimate Kinsman-Redeemer who purchases his bride.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Gentile Inclusion:</strong>
          Through Naomi's acceptance of Ruth, a Moabite enters the messianic line, anticipating Gospel inclusion of all nations.

          <h4>📖 OT Connections</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gen 38:</strong> Tamar's story echoes in Ruth 3</li>
            <li><strong>Lev 25:</strong> Redemption laws fulfilled</li>
            <li><strong>Deut 25:</strong> Levirate marriage principles</li>
            <li><strong>1 Sam 16:</strong> David from Bethlehem</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 68:5-6:</strong> God settles the solitary in families</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>✨ NT Fulfillment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Matt 1:5:</strong> Ruth in Jesus' genealogy</li>
            <li><strong>Luke 1:46-55:</strong> Mary's song echoes reversal themes</li>
            <li><strong>Rom 8:28:</strong> All things work together (providence)</li>
            <li><strong>Eph 2:12-13:</strong> Strangers brought near</li>
            <li><strong>Rev 5:9:</strong> Redeemed from every nation</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Messianic Pattern:</strong> Naomi's story establishes the pattern of God bringing life from death, fullness from emptiness, and hope from despair—ultimately fulfilled in Christ's death and resurrection. Her transformation from Mara to restored Naomi prefigures the church's journey from suffering to glory.</p>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🙏 Personal</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Hold space for honest lament while maintaining hope</li>
            <li>Recognize God's providence in ordinary circumstances</li>
            <li>Trust God's timing in restoration processes</li>
            <li>Value community support in times of crisis</li>

        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>⛪ Community</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Create systems of redemptive care for the vulnerable</li>
            <li>Practice radical hospitality to outsiders like Ruth</li>
            <li>Become agents of God's providence for the suffering</li>
            <li>Celebrate restoration stories within the congregation</li>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Contemporary Challenge:</strong> Naomi's story challenges our instant-gratification culture by showing that restoration often requires patient endurance through seasons of emptiness, and that God's providence frequently works through ordinary human kindness rather than dramatic intervention.

        <li>How does Naomi's honest lament (calling herself Mara) demonstrate a healthy relationship with God even in suffering?</li>
        <li>What can we learn about faith from Naomi's ability to recognize God's hand when Ruth "happens" to meet Boaz?</li>
        <li>How does Naomi's story connect to the larger biblical narrative of exile and return?</li>
        <li>What cultural barriers did Naomi face as a widow, and how do these relate to vulnerable populations today?</li>
        <li>How does Naomi's role in the genealogy of David (and ultimately Christ) reshape our understanding of how God uses suffering?</li>
        <li>What does the contrast between Naomi's names (Pleasant/Bitter) teach us about the relationship between identity and circumstances?</li>
        <li>How might this narrative have encouraged the original audience during or after the Babylonian exile?</li>
        <li>What aspects of Naomi's strategic planning in chapter 3 challenge assumptions about passivity in suffering?</li>
        <li>How does the women's chorus in Bethlehem function as a model for community interpretation of God's work?</li>
