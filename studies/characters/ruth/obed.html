      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
        Obed appears in the final verses of Ruth as the tangible fruit of redemption—the child born to Ruth and Boaz whose existence resolves Naomi's emptiness and continues the family line. Remarkably, he is named not by his parents but by the women of Bethlehem, who declare, "A son has been born to Naomi!" His name, meaning "Servant," anticipates his role in God's redemptive plan. Though he never speaks or acts in the narrative, his significance is cosmic: he becomes the grandfather of King David and thus an ancestor of Jesus Christ. Obed embodies the book's central message—that God brings life from death, fullness from emptiness, and hope from despair through ordinary human faithfulness.
      </p>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Obed represents the reversal of everything lost in chapter 1. Where Elimelech's sons died without children, Obed lives. Where Naomi was emptied, she is now "filled." Where the family line faced extinction, it now leads to David and the Messiah. Obed is not just a baby—he is a theological statement about God's power to bring new creation from chaos.

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Moment</h3>
      
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Conception Enabled by the LORD (Ruth 4:13):</strong> 
          "So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she bore a son." This is one of only two explicit divine actions in the book—God directly grants conception. The barrenness implied during Ruth's first marriage is overcome by divine enablement.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Women's Theological Declaration (4:14-15):</strong> 
          The women of Bethlehem interpret the birth theologically: "Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a redeemer, and may his name be renowned in Israel! He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age." The child is identified as Naomi's גֹּאֵל (redeemer)—continuing the redemption that Boaz began.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Ruth's Supreme Validation (4:15b):</strong> 
          "For your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has given birth to him." This statement represents the highest possible praise in ancient Israelite culture—a foreign woman surpasses the ideal of seven sons. Ruth's ḥesed is validated through the child she bears.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Naomi's Adoption (4:16):</strong> 
          "Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse." This tender act reverses Naomi's emptiness. The woman who returned with nothing now holds the future of Israel in her arms. The Hebrew suggests she becomes his אֹמֶנֶת (ʾōmenet)—foster mother or nurse.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Community Naming (4:17a):</strong> 
          "And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, 'A son has been born to Naomi.' They named him Obed." Remarkably, the community names the child—not Ruth, not Boaz, not Naomi. This unusual detail emphasizes that Obed belongs to the whole community; he is their collective redemption made flesh.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Genealogical Horizon (4:17b):</strong> 
          "He was the father of Jesse, the father of David." This stunning conclusion reveals that this "simple" family story is actually the origin narrative of Israel's greatest king. What seemed like a tale of provincial widows becomes the foundation of the Davidic dynasty.
        </div>

    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: LITERARY CONTEXT -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="literary-context">
      <h3>Literary Context & Function</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-4">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📚 Narrative Function</h4>
          <p>Obed is the resolution of the plot's central problem. The death of Mahlon and Chilion threatened family extinction; Obed's birth reverses this completely, restoring lineage and hope.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Structural Position</h4>
          <p>Appearing in the book's final section (4:13-22), Obed forms an inclusio with the deaths of chapter 1. Death opened the narrative; birth closes it. Emptiness began it; fullness ends it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🎭 Symbolic Character</h4>
          <p>Obed never speaks or acts—he exists as pure symbol. He represents redemption accomplished, promise fulfilled, and covenant continuing. His passivity highlights that redemption comes as gift.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>✍️ Name as Theology</h4>
          <p>"Servant" (עוֹבֵד) connects to David's role as servant-king and ultimately to Christ as the Servant of the LORD. The name points beyond itself to greater service yet to come.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Community Naming:</strong> That the "women of the neighborhood" name Obed rather than his parents is striking. In most biblical birth narratives, parents (usually mothers) name children. Here, the community names him—suggesting he belongs to all Bethlehem, not just one family. He is the embodiment of communal redemption.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 4: THEOLOGICAL THEMES -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="themes">
      <h3>Major Theological Themes</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div>
          <h4>🌱 New Creation</h4>
          <p>Obed represents new creation emerging from death. The barren woman conceives; the extinct line continues; the desolate grandmother holds new life. He embodies the resurrection pattern that runs throughout Scripture.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🔄 Reversal Complete</h4>
          <p>Everything lost in chapter 1 is restored through Obed: sons (Naomi now has a "son"), future (genealogy continues to David), name (Elimelech's line preserved), and land (secured through redemption).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>👑 Davidic Hope</h4>
          <p>The genealogy (4:17b-22) transforms a provincial story into royal history. Obed isn't just a baby—he's the grandfather of the king through whom God will establish an eternal covenant (2 Sam 7).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🌍 Gentile Inclusion</h4>
          <p>Obed's mother is a Moabite. The Davidic line—and ultimately the Messianic line—flows through a foreign woman's child. God's redemption has always included the nations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>💝 Ḥesed Made Flesh</h4>
          <p>Obed is the tangible result of Ruth's ḥesed (loyal love) toward Naomi and Boaz's ḥesed toward Ruth. He embodies covenant faithfulness producing new life.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🙏 Servant Identity</h4>
          <p>His name ("Servant") connects to David's identity as "servant of the LORD" and ultimately to Christ as the Suffering Servant. Obed's name anticipates the theology of service running through his descendants.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

          <h4>🌍 Eden Restored (Creation Themes)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fruitfulness:</strong> "Be fruitful and multiply" fulfilled through barren woman</li>
            <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Naomi finds מְנוּחָה (rest/security) through Obed</li>
            <li><strong>Blessing:</strong> The covenant blessings flow again through this child</li>

          </ul>

        <div>
          <h4>✨ Redemption Accomplished</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Goel completed:</strong> Obed is called Naomi's "redeemer" (4:14)</li>
            <li><strong>Restorer of life:</strong> מֵשִׁיב נֶפֶשׁ (meshiv nefesh, 4:15)</li>
            <li><strong>Nourisher:</strong> לְכַלְכֵּל (lekhalkel) in old age</li>
            <li><strong>Future secured:</strong> Line continues to David and beyond</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern of Redemption:</strong> Obed embodies the pattern that will characterize God's redemptive work throughout Scripture: life from death, fullness from emptiness, inclusion of the outsider, and ordinary people participating in cosmic purposes. The child in Naomi's arms is both the resolution of one family's tragedy and a link in the chain leading to the world's redemption.

      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Genealogical Link:</strong>
          Ruth 4:17-22 traces the line: Perez → Hezron → Ram → Amminadab → Nahshon → Salmon → Boaz → Obed → Jesse → David. Obed stands near the climax—just two generations from David.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Name Significance:</strong>
          "Servant" (עוֹבֵד) anticipates the Servant theology that develops through David's reign, the Servant Songs of Isaiah, and culminates in Jesus Christ, the ultimate "Servant of the LORD."
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>NT Inclusion:</strong>
          Both Matthew 1:5 and Luke 3:32 include Obed in Jesus' genealogy. Through him, Ruth the Moabite becomes an ancestor of the Messiah, demonstrating that God's salvation plan always included the nations.

        <strong>Contemporary Significance:</strong> Obed reminds us that the children of faithfulness often accomplish more than their parents could imagine. Ruth and Boaz couldn't have known their son's grandson would be king. They couldn't have known their great-great-grandchild (many times over) would be the Messiah. Ordinary faithfulness in obscure places becomes the foundation for cosmic purposes. Our task is faithfulness; significance belongs to God.
