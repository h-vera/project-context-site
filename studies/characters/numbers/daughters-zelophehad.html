      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> When Zelophehad dies without sons, his five daughters—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah—bring a legal case (mishpat) before Moses, Eleazar, and the leaders at the tent of meeting. Their courageous petition for inheritance rights receives divine approval, establishing legal precedent that daughters inherit when there are no sons, preserving family lines and demonstrating God's justice within covenant order.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The daughters' successful petition reveals Torah's capacity for wisdom-driven development in response to new circumstances. As Walton demonstrates, Torah functions not as exhaustive legislation but as "covenant wisdom"—illustrative cases that teach principles for community flourishing. Their story shows how God's law, though good and authoritative, operates as wisdom literature requiring contextual application rather than wooden implementation, embodying justice (mishpat) and inclusion while echoing the male-female co-regency of Genesis 1–2.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Family Loss & Census Notation (Num 26:33):</strong>
          Zelophehad of Manasseh dies without sons during the wilderness wandering. Unusually, his five daughters are named in the census—granting them visibility typically reserved for male heirs and foreshadowing their significance.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Public Petition at the Tent (Num 27:1–4):</strong>
          The sisters approach the entrance of the tent of meeting, presenting a formal mishpat before Moses, Eleazar, and all the leaders. Their carefully crafted argument unites family-name preservation with landed inheritance: "Why should our father's name disappear from his clan because he had no son?"
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Divine Ruling & Law (Num 27:5–11):</strong>
          Moses brings their case before the LORD, who declares "The daughters of Zelophehad are right." God not only affirms their specific claim but generalizes the ruling into Israel's inheritance law, establishing a hierarchy of succession that protects family lines when sons are absent.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Clarification for Tribal Integrity (Num 36:1–12):</strong>
          Leaders of Manasseh raise concerns about inter-tribal property drift through marriage. God instructs the daughters to marry within their clan, balancing individual justice with tribal allotment stability. The daughters obediently marry their cousins, demonstrating wisdom in accepting reasonable limitations.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Implementation in the Land (Josh 17:3–6):</strong>
          The ruling is enforced during the land allotment under Joshua's leadership. The daughters receive their inheritance among their father's brothers, confirming the durability and divine authority of the legal precedent they established.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The narrative follows a clear pattern: Petition → Divine Consultation → Ruling → Codification → Implementation. This mirrors Numbers 9's second Passover provision, showing how gaps in law are resolved through appeal to the LORD and wisdom for new contexts.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: LITERARY CONTEXT -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="literary-context">
      <h3>Literary Context & Structure</h3>
      <div class="grid-4">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📚 Position in Book</h4>
          <p>Placed in the Moab plains section as Israel prepares for settled life; ensures no clan vanishes for lack of male heirs during the transition from wilderness to land.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Literary Patterns</h4>
          <p>Five names recur across Numbers and Joshua—an emphatic device elevating their significance. Key term "mishpat" frames their appeal as justice, not mere special pleading. Douglas observes that Numbers consistently presents "hard cases" that test boundaries—the daughters' case exemplifies this pattern of exploring legal limits through narrative.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🎭 Character Function</h4>
          <p>The daughters act as reform agents within the covenant—loyal yet bold. Moses serves as mediator who seeks God's judgment rather than imposing his own interpretation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>✍️ Narrative Techniques</h4>
          <p>Courtroom-like scene with formal legal language. The decision becomes "torah" (instruction) for Israel, showing law formation in real time.</p>

      <div class="significance">
        <h4>Literary Significance</h4>
        <p>The chiastic center highlights the transformation from case-specific justice to normative statute. This structure emphasizes how individual advocacy can establish universal principles, showing Torah's capacity for contextual wisdom that serves both particular needs and communal order.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- SECTION 4: THEOLOGICAL THEMES -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="themes">
      <h3>Major Theological Themes</h3>
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Mishpat (Justice)</h4>
          <p>God affirms their case as "right," revealing Torah's capacity to address oversight and pursue justice in changing contexts. Weinfeld notes that biblical law uniquely combines procedural justice with divine concern for the vulnerable—here, women without male protectors. The daughters' success represents what Weinfeld calls "democratization of law," where marginalized voices can directly petition for justice.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>🏛️ Covenant Order & Community</h4>
          <p>Individual/family justice is balanced with tribal stability—a model for adjudicating competing goods within covenant community.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>🌿 Human Vocation & Land</h4>
          <p>Echoing Genesis 1–2, women share in landed stewardship; inheritance is about participation in God's promise, not merely property.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>📜 Law as Living Instruction</h4>
          <p>Torah operates as wisdom—good and authoritative, yet context-aware and open to Spirit-led application for new circumstances.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>👥 Gender & Inclusion</h4>
          <p>The narrative advances beyond cultural norms while working within them, showing progressive revelation of God's inclusive purposes.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>🏠 Family Name Preservation</h4>
          <p>The concern for maintaining family names in Israel reflects deeper theological themes of memory, identity, and covenant continuity.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

      <h3>Ancient Near Eastern Context & Biblical Distinctives</h3>
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📜 ANE Parallels</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Inheritance Laws:</strong> Many ANE law codes privilege sons; daughters may receive dowries but typically lack land rights unless no sons exist</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Petitions:</strong> Evidence from Mari and Nuzi shows women could bring cases before authorities, though rarely for land inheritance</li>
            <li><strong>Patriarchal Norms:</strong> Universal assumption of male property transmission in agricultural societies</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>⚡ Biblical Distinctives</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Divine Affirmation:</strong> God explicitly declares the women "right," not merely making a concession</li>
            <li><strong>Public Narration:</strong> The story is preserved and celebrated, not hidden—rare in ANE literature</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Codification:</strong> The case becomes permanent law, showing Torah's adaptability to ensure justice</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        <h4>🔍 Boundary Negotiations (Douglas)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purity & Legal Space:</strong> The daughters approach the tent of meeting's entrance—the liminal space between sacred and common—demonstrating how legal justice operates at boundaries</li>
          <li><strong>Defilement Concerns:</strong> Their father "died for his own sin" but wasn't part of Korah's rebellion—carefully distinguishing individual from corporate defilement</li>
          <li><strong>Order Through Classification:</strong> The new law creates categories (daughters, brothers, uncles) that restore order when ambiguity threatens the social system</li>
        </ul>

          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Redemption Through Crisis:</strong>
        Through courageous petition and divine wisdom, potential injustice becomes instruction for future generations. Weinfeld's research shows this pattern throughout ANE law: crisis generates legal innovation. But uniquely in Israel, God himself validates the innovation, transforming human advocacy into divine torah. The threat of family erasure becomes an occasion for expanding covenantal inclusion, preserving name and heritage while establishing principles that point toward fuller redemption.</div>

        <strong>Contemporary Challenge:</strong> When existing policies create injustice by omission, Scripture commends wise reform grounded in God's heart for justice. The daughters model what Walton calls "cultural negotiation"—working within existing structures while advocating for necessary change. Their story challenges both rigid traditionalism (law never changes) and radical revolution (abandon all structure), offering instead a model of faithful reform through proper channels.</div>
