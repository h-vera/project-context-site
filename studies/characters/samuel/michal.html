      <p><strong>Summary:</strong>
        Michal, younger daughter of King Saul, is the first woman in all Scripture explicitly described as loving a man: "Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David" (1 Sam 18:20). Her story begins with romantic love and courageous action—she saves David's life by lowering him through a window and deceiving her father's assassins. Yet her narrative arc is profoundly tragic, moving from love and loyalty to bitterness and barrenness. Caught between her father Saul (God's rejected king) and her husband David (God's chosen king), Michal represents the impossible position of Saul's house. She is twice married: first to David for political purposes (Saul hoping she'd be "a snare," 1 Sam 18:21), then forcibly given to Palti son of Laish when Saul breaks the marriage, and finally reclaimed by David as political trophy. Her story culminates in 2 Samuel 6 when she despises David's ecstatic worship before the ark, leading to her permanent barrenness—divine judgment marking the end of Saul's dynastic hopes. Unlike other barren women in Scripture (Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah) whose barrenness precedes miraculous blessing, Michal's barrenness is final and punitive, symbolizing her alienation from God's purposes and the death of Saul's line.
      </p>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Michal's life illustrates the tragic cost of divided loyalties, misplaced pride, and resistance to God's anointed. Her trajectory from love to contempt mirrors Saul's house declining while David's rises. She embodies several crucial theological tensions: (1) Love corrupted by bitterness when loyalties divide, (2) courageous action (saving David) undermined by later pride (despising worship), (3) political marriage reducing persons to pawns, (4) barrenness as judgment not blessing—opposite of Sarah/Hannah pattern, and (5) worship requiring humility that pride destroys. Most profoundly, Michal serves as negative typology: not the true bride of God's anointed but the rejecting critic, foreshadowing Israel's rejection of Messiah. Her name "Who is like God?" becomes tragically ironic—she questions not rhetorically (honoring God's uniqueness) but critically (challenging God's choice of David and David's worship style). Her story warns: proximity to God's anointed doesn't guarantee blessing if heart grows cold; initial love means nothing if not sustained; worship critique rooted in pride leads to spiritual barrenness.

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <section class="theology-card" id="narrative">
      <h2>Narrative Journey</h2>
      
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Background: Saul's Dynastic Strategy (1 Sam 18:17-19):</strong>
          Before Michal's introduction, Saul offers older daughter Merab to David, saying "Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD's battles"—hoping David will die in combat. But when time comes to give Merab, Saul gives her to Adriel the Meholathite instead. This broken promise sets stage for Michal's story: Saul weaponizes daughters as political tools, marriage proposals as death traps.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Love and Marriage Trap (1 Sam 18:20-29):</strong>
          "Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David" (v. 20)—extraordinary statement, first time Scripture says woman loved man (men love women: Jacob loved Rachel Gen 29:18; but woman loving man is unique). The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">וַתֶּאֱהַב מִיכַל בַּת־שָׁאוּל אֶת־דָּוִד</span> (vatte'ehav Mikhal bat-Shaul et-David) emphasizes her agency and emotion. "When they told Saul, the thing pleased him" (v. 20)—not pleased for daughter's happiness but strategic opportunity. Saul schemes: "Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for him" (v. 21). He demands bride price of 100 Philistine foreskins, "thinking to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines" (v. 25). David doubles it—brings 200 foreskins—and marries Michal. The text concludes: "Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him. And Saul was even more afraid of David" (vv. 28-29). Michal's love, meant to trap David, actually demonstrates God's favor. Her agency (loving) contrasts father's manipulation (snaring), but she's caught in Saul's political machinations from the start.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Saving David's Life (1 Sam 19:11-17):</strong>
          When Saul sends messengers to David's house to kill him at dawn, "Michal, David's wife, told him, 'If you do not escape with your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed'" (v. 11). She acts decisively: "So Michal let David down through the window, and he fled away and escaped" (v. 12). Then she creates deception—places <span class="hebrew">תְּרָפִים</span> (teraphim, household idol/image) in bed with goat-hair pillow at head, covers with garment, tells messengers David is sick. When they return to actually kill sick David, they discover ruse. Saul confronts her: "Why have you deceived me thus and let my enemy go?" (v. 17). Michal's response is self-preservation through lie: "He said to me, 'Let me go. Why should I kill you?'" (v. 17)—implying David threatened her, which text never indicates. This moment reveals complexity: she courageously saves David (loyalty to husband) but lies to father (protecting herself), using idol as prop (religious ambiguity), claiming duress falsely (self-justification). Love motivates rescue, but fear motivates deception of Saul.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Separation: Given to Another (1 Sam 25:44):</strong>
          Amidst narrative of David in wilderness, Nabal encounter, marriage to Abigail, comes devastating note: "Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim" (v. 44). Hebrew construction emphasizes possession and violation: Saul "gave" (נָתַן, natan) Michal—she's property transferred. The verse calls her "daughter" (Saul's possession) and "David's wife" (David's possession) simultaneously—she belongs to men, not herself. Saul breaks legitimate marriage unilaterally, remarrying her to Palti (also called Paltiel 2 Sam 3:15). This political act: (1) severs David from Saul's house, (2) declares David's marriage void, (3) humiliates David publicly, (4) treats Michal as chattel. Text gives no indication Michal consented or protested—she vanishes from narrative, married to another man while first husband lives. For Michal: love crushed by father's politics, agency stripped, life determined by male power games. This separation lasts years—through David's time in wilderness, Saul's death, David's reign in Hebron.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Return to David: Political Trophy (2 Sam 3:13-16):</strong>
          Years later, when Abner wants to bring northern tribes to David, David sets condition: "I will not see your face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me" (v. 13). David demands to Ish-bosheth: "Give me my wife Michal, for whom I paid the bridal price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines" (v. 14). Language is possessive, transactional—"my wife," price paid, owed property. Ish-bosheth complies: "sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish" (v. 15). Then comes one of Scripture's most poignant moments: "But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, 'Go, return.' And he returned" (v. 16). Paltiel loves Michal—follows weeping until ordered back. Text never says Michal wept, never records her voice, never indicates her desire. She's object transferred between men, silent and powerless. David's motive is political: (1) legitimizes claim to Saul's throne through marriage to Saul's daughter, (2) demonstrates power over Saul's house, (3) symbolic possession of what Saul tried to withhold. For Michal: torn from potentially loving marriage with Paltiel, returned to first husband who doesn't seek her for love but for politics. How does this affect her? Text stays silent until the telling moment in 2 Samuel 6.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Contempt and Confrontation (2 Sam 6:16-23):</strong>
          When David brings ark to Jerusalem, he dances "before the LORD with all his might," wearing linen ephod (priestly garment, minimal clothing). "And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart" (v. 16). The phrase "daughter of Saul" (not "David's wife") signals her perspective—she sees through father's eyes, judges by royal protocol, values dignity over worship. The verb <span class="hebrew">וַתִּבֶז</span> (vattivez) "despised" is strong—contempt, scorn, disdain. After celebrations, "David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David" (v. 20)—she initiates confrontation. Her words drip with sarcasm: "How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants' female servants, as one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!" (v. 20). She attacks: (1) his kingship ("king of Israel" - should act regally), (2) his exposure (implying indecency), (3) his audience (lowly servant girls), (4) his class (vulgar fellows), (5) his shame (shameless exposure). Everything about her critique centers on status, propriety, royal dignity—Saul's values. David's response is fierce: "It was before the LORD, who chose me above your father and above all his house... I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in your eyes. But by the female servants of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor" (vv. 21-22). He asserts: (1) worship was "before the LORD" not performance for people, (2) LORD chose him over Saul's house—direct rejection of her family's claim, (3) he'll be even more undignified in worship, (4) those she scorns (servant girls) will honor him while she (princess) despises. Brutal exchange revealing irreconcilable divide. The text concludes: "And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death" (v. 23). Barrenness is judgment—whether God closing womb or David ceasing relations or both, text presents it as consequence of despising worship and God's anointed.
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Tragic Arc:</strong> Michal's journey forms perfect tragedy: from love (freely given) to contempt (bitterly expressed), from courageous protector (saving David's life) to proud critic (despising David's worship), from hope of dynasty (Saul's daughter + David's wife) to barren erasure (no children = no future). Her story demonstrates how bitterness poisons love, how political manipulation destroys relationships, how pride blinds to true worship, and how resisting God's purposes leads to spiritual death. Unlike her brother Jonathan who chooses David over father, Michal ultimately chooses father's values over husband's worship. Her name "Who is like God?" shifts from question exalting God's uniqueness to implicit challenge: "Who is like God that I should humble myself?" Pride answers the question wrongly.

          <h4>📚 Position in Book</h4>
          <p>Episodes frame David's rise (1 Sam 18-19) and establishment (2 Sam 6). First appearance during Saul's jealousy, last during ark's arrival—brackets David's journey from fugitive to king. Michal represents Saul's house throughout.</p>

        <h4>Key Hebrew Terms & Concepts</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><span class="hebrew">מִיכַל</span> (Mikhal):</strong> "Who is like God?" from <span class="hebrew">מִי כָּאֵל</span> (mi ka-el), theophoric question name like Michael, Micaiah. Rhetorical question exalting God's uniqueness—"no one is like God!" Ironic given her critique of worship. Alternatively from <span class="hebrew">מִיכָל</span> "brook" suggesting fluidity, change (fitting her shifting loyalties).</li>
          <li><strong><span class="hebrew">וַתֶּאֱהַב</span> (vatte'ehav, 1 Sam 18:20):</strong> "And she loved"—first biblical instance of woman loving man. Verb אָהַב (ahav) = love (emotional/covenantal). Her agency, emotions named—rare for women in ancient texts. Makes later contempt more tragic.</li>
          <li><strong><span class="hebrew">לְמוֹקֵשׁ</span> (lemoqesh, 1 Sam 18:21):</strong> "For a snare/trap"—Saul's intent for marriage. From יָקַשׁ (yaqash) = to ensnare, trap. Reduces Michal to weapon against David, her love weaponized.</li>
          <li><strong><span class="hebrew">תְּרָפִים</span> (teraphim, 1 Sam 19:13):</strong> "Household idol(s)"—pl. form, possibly human-shaped image. Used for deception (bed dummy). Presence in David's house problematic—why idol there? Suggests syncretism or Michal's family ties to pagan practices. Ironic: false god image saves true God's anointed.</li>
          <li><strong><span class="hebrew">וַתִּבֶז לוֹ בְּלִבָּהּ</span> (vattivez lo b'libbah, 2 Sam 6:16):</strong> "And she despised him in her heart"—internal contempt before external confrontation. בָּזָה (bazah) = despise, scorn, hold in contempt. Same verb used for Esau despising birthright (Gen 25:34), Israelites despising God (Num 15:31). Serious spiritual rejection.</li>
          <li><strong><span class="hebrew">בַּת־שָׁאוּל</span> (bat-Shaul, 2 Sam 6:16, 20, 23):</strong> "Daughter of Saul"—repeated 3x in 2 Sam 6, never "wife of David" in this chapter. Identifies her perspective, loyalties, judgment. She sees as Saul's daughter, not David's wife—telling shift from 1 Sam 18:20 where "loved David."</li>
          <li><strong><span class="hebrew">וּלְמִיכַל בַּת־שָׁאוּל לֹא־הָיָה לָהּ יָלֶד עַד יוֹם מוֹתָהּ</span> (2 Sam 6:23):</strong> "And to Michal daughter of Saul there was no child until the day of her death"—final verdict. Permanent barrenness, no future, Saul's line ends in her. Contrasts with David's many children through other wives.</li>

        <h4>Structural Significance</h4>
        <p>The chiasm emphasizes tragic reversal: love (A) → contempt (A'), protection (B) → confrontation (B'), marriage (C) → estrangement (C'). The CENTER is Paltiel weeping—Michal torn from potentially loving relationship, returned to loveless political arrangement. Everything before center shows promise; everything after shows judgment. The structure mirrors Saul's house declining while David's rises, with Michal caught in the middle—her trajectory from beloved wife to barren critic parallels Saul's fall from anointed king to rejected predecessor. Love cannot survive political manipulation, and bitterness from such manipulation poisons even genuine worship.</p>

      <h2>Major Theological Themes</h2>
      
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div>
          <h4>💔 Love Corrupted by Politics</h4>
          <p>Michal's genuine love for David (1 Sam 18:20) weaponized by Saul as "snare," violated by forced remarriage, destroyed by political reclamation. Demonstrates how human institutions (political marriage) corrupt divine gifts (love). Her tragedy: real love reduced to dynastic pawn.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Divided Loyalties Destroy</h4>
          <p>Caught between father (Saul) and husband (David), Michal ultimately chooses father's values (royal dignity, protocol) over husband's worship (humble abandon before God). "Daughter of Saul" identity trumps "wife of David" covenent—fatal choice mirroring Israel's future rejection of Messiah.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🙏 Worship vs. Pride</h4>
          <p>David's ecstatic, undignified worship (dancing in ephod before servant girls) vs. Michal's scornful critique (royal propriety, concern for status). Pride cannot tolerate humility before God. Her contempt for worship reveals heart alienated from God—performance matters more than passion, dignity more than devotion.</p>
        </div>

          <h4>🚫 Barrenness as Judgment</h4>
          <p>Uniquely in Scripture, Michal's barrenness is final judgment, not prelude to blessing. Unlike Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah (barren then blessed), Michal remains childless "until death" (2 Sam 6:23). Symbolizes end of Saul's dynastic hopes and alienation from God's purposes—spiritual barrenness manifested physically.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>👩 Women as Political Pawns</h4>
          <p>Michal given in marriage as trap (1 Sam 18:21), transferred to another man without consent (25:44), reclaimed as political trophy (2 Sam 3:14). Her agency erased by male power structures. Yet her story critiques such treatment—Paltiel weeping, David's coldness, Michal's bitterness all indict system that reduces women to property.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🏰 Representative of Saul's House</h4>
          <p>Michal embodies Saul's dynasty: initially chosen/favored, ultimately rejected/barren. Her contempt for David's worship parallels Saul's disobedience. Her barrenness symbolizes Saul's line ending. She demonstrates that proximity to God's anointed doesn't guarantee blessing if heart grows cold.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>The Cost of Bitterness:</strong> Michal's tragedy demonstrates how bitterness—however justified by suffering—poisons love and blinds to true worship. She has reason for bitterness: father weaponized her love, forced her into second marriage, first husband reclaimed her as trophy not wife. Yet bitterness doesn't lead to healing but to scorn, not to wisdom but to worship-contempt. Her story warns: justified grievances can still produce unjustified responses. The very pride protecting wounded dignity (critiquing David's humility) ensures permanent wounding (barrenness, alienation). Unlike Hannah who channeled barrenness-grief into transformative prayer, Michal channels marriage-grief into destructive contempt. Both women childless, but Hannah's humility leads to fruitfulness while Michal's pride leads to perpetual barrenness.

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📜 ANE Parallels</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Political Marriage:</strong> Royal daughters given to cement alliances, create vassalage, unite kingdoms—common throughout ANE (cf. Mari letters, Amarna correspondence)</li>
            <li><strong>Women as Property:</strong> Transferred between men, marriages broken/remade by male authorities without female consent—standard patriarchal practice</li>
            <li><strong>Bride Price (Mohar):</strong> Payment to bride's family—David's 100/200 foreskins extreme version, proving prowess and commitment</li>
            <li><strong>Royal Dignity:</strong> Kings expected to maintain honor, avoid shameful behavior—Michal's critique reflects ANE royal protocol</li>
            <li><strong>Teraphim (Household Gods):</strong> Common in ANE homes (cf. Rachel stealing Laban's Gen 31:19)—family protection, inheritance rights, household worship</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>⚡ Biblical Distinctives</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Woman's Love Named:</strong> Unique in ANE literature—woman's emotions (love for David) explicitly stated, giving her interiority, agency, personhood</li>
            <li><strong>Critique of Political Marriage:</strong> While depicting practice, text critiques through Paltiel's tears, Michal's bitterness—shows human cost of treating women as political tools</li>
            <li><strong>Barrenness as Judgment:</strong> Theological, not just social—Michal's childlessness marks divine rejection of Saul's house, unlike ANE where barrenness merely shameful</li>
            <li><strong>Worship Priority:</strong> David prioritizes worship over royal dignity—countercultural to ANE where kingship demanded maintained honor. God values humility over status.</li>
            <li><strong>Prophetic Critique:</strong> Michal's story functions prophetically—warns against pride, divided loyalties, worship-contempt. Not just political history but theological instruction.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="word-study">
        <h4>Cultural Context: The Teraphim Incident</h4>
        <p><strong>What Were Teraphim?</strong> Household gods/images, possibly human-shaped (given use as bed-dummy). Associated with divination (Ezek 21:21), household protection, inheritance rights. Rachel stole Laban's (Gen 31:19), suggesting family significance beyond mere superstition.</p>
        <p><strong>Why in David's House?</strong> Three possibilities: (1) Michal brought from Saul's palace as part of dowry/possessions, (2) tolerated syncretism in early Israel, or (3) specifically acquired for this deception (least likely). Presence problematic given David's later devotion to YHWH exclusively.</p>
        <p><strong>Irony:</strong> False god-image (teraphim) used to save true God's anointed (David). Deception through idol saves man who will establish worship in Jerusalem. Michal uses household god to protect husband but later despises husband's worship of household God (ark = God's presence). Spiritual ambiguity foreshadows later contempt for worship.</p>

      <div class="grid-2">

          <h4>🌍 Creation Ideals Inverted</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Love and Union:</strong> Created for "one flesh" unity (Gen 2:24), but Michal's marriages broken by politics, love corrupted by manipulation, union fractured by forced separation</li>
            <li><strong>Woman as Helper:</strong> Michal helps David (saves life) but later hinders (contempt for worship)—helper design twisted by bitterness and divided loyalties</li>
            <li><strong>Fruitfulness Mandate:</strong> "Be fruitful and multiply" (Gen 1:28) reversed—Michal's barrenness is curse not blessing, end not beginning</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🍎 Fall Patterns Manifested</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Deception:</strong> Like Eve, Michal uses deception (idol/lie to Saul) but without redemptive outcome—saves David temporarily but relationship doesn't survive</li>
            <li><strong>Blame and Shame:</strong> Michal blames David for "shameless" behavior (2 Sam 6:20), echoing Adam blaming Eve, Eve blaming serpent—passing responsibility for her contempt</li>
            <li><strong>Pride and Alienation:</strong> Pride protecting dignity actually ensures alienation—from husband, from worship, from future (children). Fall's pattern: self-protection produces self-destruction</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Redemption Absent:</strong>
        Uniquely tragic, Michal's story offers no redemption arc. Unlike other biblical failures (David after adultery, Peter after denial, Israel after exile), Michal receives no restoration. Her barrenness "until death" marks permanent judgment. This underscores severity of despising God's anointed and true worship—some rejections have irreversible consequences. Her story warns rather than comforts, functions as cautionary tale rather than redemptive narrative. Yet even in her tragedy, redemption occurs around her: David's line continues through other wives, ark establishes worship in Jerusalem, God's purposes advance despite human resistance. She represents what happens when pride refuses humility, when bitterness rejects worship, when divided loyalties choose wrong side. Her permanent exclusion from God's blessing (childlessness) foreshadows Israel's exile when choosing pride over obedience.

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Negative Typology—Not True Bride:</strong>
          Michal as David's first wife should parallel church as Christ's bride, but instead becomes negative typology—rejecting critic rather than rejoicing bride. Her contempt for worship anticipates Israel's rejection of Messiah. Her barrenness symbolizes spiritual fruitlessness of those who reject God's anointed.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Worship Humility vs. Religious Pride:</strong>
          David's undignified dancing (like child before LORD) anticipates Jesus' teaching: "Unless you become like children..." (Matt 18:3). Michal's scorn parallels Pharisees criticizing Jesus for eating with sinners, healing on Sabbath—protocol over passion, dignity over devotion.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Divided Loyalties—Can't Serve Two Masters:</strong>
          Michal caught between Saul (father) and David (husband) unable to fully commit to either foreshadows Jesus' warning: "No one can serve two masters" (Matt 6:24). Her tragedy: choosing wrong master (Saul's values over David's worship).
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Barrenness as Spiritual Death:</strong>
          Unlike barren-then-blessed women (Sarah→Isaac, Rachel→Joseph, Hannah→Samuel, Elizabeth→John Baptist), Michal remains barren—spiritual death without resurrection. Foreshadows Jesus' teaching about fruitless branches cut off (John 15:2), trees without fruit cursed (Matt 21:19).

            <li>Learn from Michal's tragedy: joy in God's presence is essential, not optional. Worship without joy becomes ritual without relationship</li>
            <li>Support those with divided family loyalties—don't force immediate choice but model how to navigate gradual alignment with God's purposes</li>

        <strong>Contemporary Challenge:</strong> Michal challenges churches in age of carefully curated worship, professional excellence, and concern for "how things look" to outsiders. Her scorn for David's undignified dancing warns against privileging decorum over devotion, image over abandon, dignity over joy. Yet her story also warns individuals against bitterness that masquerades as discernment, pride that calls itself dignity, contempt that claims to be standards. The question her story poses: Do you despise worship that embarrasses you? Do you critique others' passion because it challenges your reserve? Does concern for "how it looks" trump concern for "how God receives it"? Michal represents church members who've been hurt by leadership (Saul/David parallel), who value propriety over passion, who critique from windows rather than dance in streets. Her permanent barrenness warns: such critique produces no fruit, builds no future, births no blessing. The path of humility (Hannah praying, David dancing, Mary magnifying) leads to fruitfulness. The path of pride (Michal scorning) leads to permanent barrenness. Which worship posture are you cultivating?

        <div class="citation-note">
          <p><strong>Note on Sources:</strong> Michal's story, spanning 1-2 Samuel with multiple key episodes, has generated significant scholarly attention addressing: political marriage dynamics, women's agency in patriarchal contexts, literary characterization, worship theology, and barrenness as judgment motif. Firth and Brueggemann provide excellent theological frameworks. Alter offers essential literary analysis. Meyers and Exum illuminate social-historical contexts and feminist perspectives.</p>
          <p><strong>For Further Study:</strong> For political marriage in ANE, see Levenson & Halpern's article. For worship theology in 2 Samuel 6, consult commentaries on ark narratives. For comparative study of barren women, examine Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah profiles. For Saul's house decline, study Jonathan, Ish-bosheth, Mephibosheth narratives.</p>
