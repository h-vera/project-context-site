<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<div class="theology-card" id="overview">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <div class="meta">
    <div class="kv"><strong>Scripture:</strong> 1 Samuel 18:20–29; 19:11–17; 25:44; 2 Samuel 3:13–16; 6:16–23</div>
    <div class="kv"><strong>Hebrew:</strong> מִיכַל (Mikhal) – "Who is like God?"</div>
    <div class="kv"><strong>Etymology:</strong> מִי (mi = "who") + כַּ (ka = "like") + אֵל (el = "God")</div>
    <div class="kv"><strong>Role:</strong> Daughter of King Saul, first wife of David</div>
    <div class="kv"><strong>Setting:</strong> Early Israelite monarchy (Saul's and David's reigns)</div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Michal is the younger daughter of King Saul and the first woman in Scripture described as loving a man (1 Sam 18:20). She protects David from Saul's wrath, saving his life. Yet her story ends in estrangement: she is given to another man, later returned to David, and finally despises David's worship before the ark. Her narrative arc moves from love and loyalty to bitterness and barrenness.</p>
  <div class="key-insight"><strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Michal's life illustrates the tragic cost of divided loyalties and misplaced pride. She is caught between her father Saul and her husband David, and her story ends in judgment. In contrast to other barren women in Scripture who are later vindicated, Michal remains barren, symbolizing her alienation from God's purposes.</div>

<!-- NARRATIVE -->
<div class="theology-card" id="narrative">
  <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
  <div class="timeline">
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Love and Marriage (1 Sam 18:20–28):</strong> Michal loves David, and Saul gives her to him, hoping she will be a snare. Her marriage is thus both romantic and political.</div>
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Saving David (1 Sam 19:11–17):</strong> When Saul sends assassins, Michal lowers David through a window and deceives the pursuers with an idol in bed.</div>
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Separation (1 Sam 25:44):</strong> Saul breaks the marriage by giving Michal to Palti son of Laish, severing her bond with David.</div>
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Return to David (2 Sam 3:13–16):</strong> David demands her back as a political condition. The text poignantly describes Palti weeping as she is taken away.</div>
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Contempt and Barrenness (2 Sam 6:16–23):</strong> Michal despises David's public worship, mocks him, and is left childless until death.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="key-insight"><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Michal begins as a loving, proactive protector but ends as a critic estranged from God's anointed king. Her life is a reversal from promise to judgment.</div>
</div>

<!-- LITERARY CONTEXT -->
<div class="theology-card" id="literary-context">
  <h3>Literary Context & Structure</h3>
  <div class="grid-4">
    <div class="panel"><h4>📚 Position in Book</h4><p>Her episodes frame key moments in David's rise (1 Sam 18–19; 2 Sam 6). Michal functions as a foil to Jonathan's loyalty and as a counterpoint to Hannah's and Abigail's faithfulness.</p></div>
    <div class="panel"><h4>🔄 Literary Patterns</h4><p>Michal's story moves from love (18:20) to estrangement (6:23), forming an inclusio. She protects David in secret, but later despises him in public.</p></div>
    <div class="panel"><h4>🎭 Character Function</h4><p>Foil to Jonathan (loyal son vs. resentful daughter). Represents Saul's house as opposed to David's destiny.</p></div>
    <div class="panel"><h4>✍️ Narrative Techniques</h4><p>Irony: Michal loves David but ends unloved. Her barrenness contrasts with God's blessing on David's other wives. Sarcasm in 2 Sam 6:20 intensifies the rupture with David.</p></div>
  </div>

  <h3>Ancient Near Eastern Context & Biblical Distinctives</h3>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div><h4>📜 ANE Parallels</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Royal daughters given in marriage to cement alliances (cf. Mari letters).</li>
        <li>Women as political pawns in treaties and dynastic struggles.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div><h4>⚡ Biblical Distinctives</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Michal is named, given a voice, and described as loving—a rare feature in ANE texts.</li>
        <li>Her barrenness functions as divine judgment, tying political destiny to theological themes.</li>

  <h3>Creation, Fall & Redemption Patterns</h3>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div><h4>🌍 Eden Echoes</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Love and union at first, but broken by pride and blame.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div><h4>🍎 Fall Patterns</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Like Eve, Michal uses deception (idol in bed) but without long-term blessing.</li>
        <li>Her pride at worship parallels human resistance to God's presence.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="key-insight"><strong>Redemption Through Crisis:</strong> Unlike Hannah, whose barrenness leads to blessing, Michal's barrenness marks judgment, underscoring God's sovereign choice of David's line.</div>

<!-- MESSIANIC -->

  <h3>Messianic Trajectory & NT Connections</h3>
  <div class="timeline">
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Negative Typology:</strong> Michal is not the true "bride" of God's anointed. Her contempt anticipates Israel's rejection of its Messiah.</div>
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Foil to the Church:</strong> The NT presents the Church as the bride rejoicing in Christ (Eph 5; Rev 19), unlike Michal who despises worship.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div><h4>📖 OT Connections</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Hannah (1 Sam 1–2): barren yet vindicated, opposite of Michal.</li>
        <li>Sara & Rebekah: barren but blessed—contrast.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div><h4>✨ NT Fulfillment</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Luke 1: Mary rejoices in worship (Magnificat) unlike Michal's scorn.</li>
        <li>Ephesians 5: Church as bride, embracing Christ joyfully.</li>
