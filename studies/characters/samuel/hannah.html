      <p><strong>Summary:</strong>
        Hannah emerges in 1 Samuel as the paradigmatic woman of faith whose personal anguish becomes the catalyst for Israel's transformation from judges to monarchy. Her story of barrenness, prayer, and divine answer frames the entire Samuel narrative. Through her vow to dedicate her son to Yahweh and her prophetic song, Hannah becomes the theological interpreter of God's kingdom purposes. Her prayer (1 Sam 2:1-10) introduces the book's major themes: reversal, divine sovereignty, and the coming anointed king, making her not merely Samuel's mother but a prophetic voice announcing God's new work in Israel.
      </p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Hannah's story and song function as the theological overture to the books of Samuel, establishing the pattern of God exalting the humble and bringing down the proud. Her personal deliverance becomes paradigmatic for Israel's national deliverance, and her prophetic anticipation of an "anointed one" (mashiach) introduces the messianic trajectory that will run through David to Christ.

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <section class="theology-card" id="narrative">
      <h2>Narrative Journey</h2>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Barrenness and Provocation (1 Sam 1:1-8):</strong>
          Hannah, beloved but barren, endures yearly provocation from her rival Peninnah who has children. At the annual pilgrimage to Shiloh, Hannah weeps and refuses food, embodying Israel's own barrenness in the period of the judges. Her husband Elkanah's love cannot compensate for her shame and longing for a child.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Vow at Shiloh (1 Sam 1:9-18):</strong>
          In "bitterness of soul" (מרת נפש), Hannah prays silently at the tabernacle, vowing to give any son back to Yahweh as a Nazirite. Eli the priest initially mistakes her passionate prayer for drunkenness but then blesses her. She leaves with peace, her countenance transformed—faith preceding fulfillment.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Birth and Dedication of Samuel (1 Sam 1:19-28):</strong>
          God "remembers" Hannah (as He remembered Rachel), and she conceives Samuel ("heard of God"). After weaning him (likely around age 3), she fulfills her vow, bringing Samuel to serve at Shiloh permanently. Her radical surrender demonstrates complete trust: "I have lent him to the LORD."
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Prophetic Song (1 Sam 2:1-10):</strong>
          Hannah's prayer transforms from personal thanksgiving to cosmic theology. She celebrates reversal (mighty fallen, weak made strong), proclaims Yahweh's sovereignty, and culminates with the first biblical reference to God's "anointed" (משיח, mashiach) king—prophesying the Davidic monarchy before Israel even requests a king.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Blessed Fruitfulness (1 Sam 2:18-21):</strong>
          After surrendering Samuel, Hannah receives five more children (three sons, two daughters), demonstrating the principle Jesus would later teach: those who lose their life find it. Her initial "loan" to God yields abundant return, establishing the pattern of sacrificial faith rewarded.
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Hannah's journey from barrenness to fruitfulness, from silence to song, from shame to honor, establishes the reversal pattern that will characterize God's kingdom work throughout Samuel-Kings and ultimately in the gospel.

        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Literary Patterns</h4>

    <!-- SECTION 4: THEOLOGICAL THEMES -->
    <section class="theology-card" id="themes">
      <h2>Major Theological Themes</h2>
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div>
          <h4>🔄 Divine Reversal</h4>
          <p>God lifts the lowly, brings down the proud. Barren becomes mother of nations' prophet. Personal story becomes national paradigm. <em>(Theme emphasized by The Bible Project, Episode 6)</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🙏 Prayer & Faith</h4>
          <p>Model of persistent, passionate prayer. Faith demonstrated through radical surrender. Prayer as conversation with God.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>👑 Kingdom Anticipation</h4>
          <p>First mention of God's "anointed" (mashiach). Prophetic vision of coming king. Personal deliverance anticipates national.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Divine Sovereignty</h4>
          <p>"Yahweh kills and makes alive." God controls fertility, history, destiny. Human agency within divine providence.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🎁 Sacrificial Devotion</h4>
          <p>Giving God what is most precious. Vow fulfillment despite cost. Model of consecration—opposite of taking the firstborn for oneself. <em>(Firstborn theology per The Bible Project)</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>🌟 Grace Embodied</h4>
          <p>Name means "grace"—she both receives and extends it. From bitterness to praise. Grace multiplied in fruitfulness.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>The Bible Project Insight:</strong> Hannah represents the ideal response to God's testing—unlike Abraham and Sarah who schemed, or Jacob who deceived, Hannah simply trusts and surrenders. She passes the test "with flying colors," voluntarily offering her firstborn back to God before being asked, embodying perfect faith and devotion (The Bible Project, "Hannah's Poem and Power Reversals," 2023).

        <strong>Redemption Through Crisis:</strong>
        Hannah's barrenness becomes the occasion for God to raise up Samuel, who will anoint David, in whose line the Messiah comes. Personal crisis becomes redemptive history. God's delays serve larger purposes than individual relief.
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fef3c7 0%, #fed7aa 100%); border-left-color: var(--warning);">
        <strong>The Bible Project Analysis - Hannah as the Model of Faith:</strong>
        Unlike the matriarchs before her, Hannah represents a new paradigm. Where Sarah and Abraham schemed to get a son through Hagar, where Rachel competed with Leah using mandrakes and surrogates, Hannah simply prays and trusts. She doesn't manipulate or take matters into her own hands. Most remarkably, she voluntarily surrenders her firstborn to God's service—the opposite of grasping for the firstborn blessing that characterized Genesis. She "passes the test" that her predecessors failed, modeling perfect surrender and faith. This makes her song not just personal thanksgiving but theological interpretation of how God's kingdom operates through willing surrender rather than human striving (The Bible Project, "Hannah's Poem and Power Reversals," 2023).

          <strong>First "Anointed" Reference:</strong>
          Hannah's song introduces mashiach (anointed/messiah) to Scripture, prophetically anticipating David and ultimately Christ.

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Reversal Theology:</strong>
          Her song's reversal theme (mighty brought low, humble exalted) becomes central to Jesus' teaching and Mary's Magnificat.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Model for Mary:</strong>
          Mary's Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55) extensively echoes Hannah's song, showing Hannah as prototype for the Messiah's mother.

        <div class="timeline-item">

          🎵 View Hannah's Song (1 Samuel 2:1-10)
        </a>
      </p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Liturgical Significance:</strong>
        Hannah's song functions as the theological lens for interpreting the entire Samuel-Kings narrative. It introduces themes of reversal, divine sovereignty, and messianic hope that shape Israel's understanding of kingship and ultimately point to Christ.

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Contemporary Challenge:</strong> Hannah's story challenges modern individualism by showing how personal crisis serves communal redemption. Her willingness to surrender her answered prayer for God's larger purposes confronts our tendency to see God's gifts as personal possessions rather than kingdom resources.

        <li>How does Hannah's personal story of barrenness and fruitfulness relate to Israel's national condition in the period of judges?</li>
        <li>What does Hannah's silent prayer teach about the nature of prayer and divine-human communication?</li>
        <li>How does Hannah's song go beyond personal thanksgiving to become prophetic theology?</li>
        <li>In what ways does Hannah's radical surrender of Samuel challenge contemporary views of parenting and stewardship?</li>
        <li>How does the Hannah-Peninnah rivalry reflect and transform the rival wife narratives in Genesis?</li>
        <li>What is the significance of Hannah being the first to use the term "anointed" (mashiach) in Scripture?</li>
        <li>How does Hannah's story shape our understanding of waiting, faith, and divine timing?</li>
        <li>What parallels between Hannah's song and Mary's Magnificat reveal about God's consistent patterns in redemptive history?</li>
        <li>How does Hannah model a different response to testing than the patriarchs and matriarchs in Genesis?</li>
        <li>What does Hannah's fruitfulness after surrendering Samuel teach about the principle of losing life to find it?</li>
