      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Tamar, the only daughter of Absalom mentioned in Scripture, bears the name of her tragic aunt who was violated by Amnon. Born after Absalom's return from exile, she represents both memorial and hope—remembering injustice while embodying beauty and continuity. Chronicles suggests she (possibly under the name Maacah) enters the legitimate Davidic line through marriage, bridging the rebellious Absalom's line back into Judah's dynasty.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> This Tamar transforms a name of tragedy into one of restoration. While her aunt Tamar lived "desolate," this Tamar is described as "beautiful" and fruitful, entering the royal genealogy. Her story demonstrates how God can redeem painful family histories, using memorial names to both honor the violated and point toward restoration.

    <!-- NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card glass-premium animate-on-scroll" id="narrative" data-section-priority="2">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Birth as Memorial (2 Sam 14:27):</strong>
          Born to Absalom after his return from three-year exile in Geshur. Absalom names his only recorded daughter after his violated sister, making her a living memorial to family tragedy and his quest for justice.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Beauty Emphasized (2 Sam 14:27):</strong>
          Described as "a beautiful woman" (אִשָּׁה יְפַת מַרְאֶה), the same phrase used for her namesake aunt. This beauty, however, leads not to tragedy but to honor—redemptive reversal of her aunt's story.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Three Brothers (2 Sam 14:27):</strong>
          Has three brothers who remain unnamed and apparently die young (no record of their survival). Tamar alone carries Absalom's legacy forward, inverting typical patriarchal expectations.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Possible Marriage into Royal Line (2 Chr 11:20-21):</strong>
          If identified with Maacah, she marries Rehoboam and becomes his most beloved wife, mother of Abijah (next king of Judah). This would mean the rebel Absalom's line rejoins legitimate Davidic succession through a woman.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Tamar's trajectory reverses her aunt's: from beauty to honor rather than violation; from memorial of tragedy to bridge of restoration; from desolation to dynasty. She embodies redemption of traumatic family history.

      <h4><span class="icon-svg" data-icon="alert"></span> Textual Clarification</h4>
      <p><strong>Distinguishing the Tamars:</strong> This profile concerns Tamar, daughter of Absalom (2 Sam 14:27), not to be confused with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tamar, daughter of David (2 Sam 13) - Absalom's sister who was violated</li>
        <li>Tamar in Genesis 38 - Judah's daughter-in-law</li>
        <li>The erroneous tradition of a "Tamar daughter of Solomon" (not in Hebrew text)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The Maacah Connection:</strong> 2 Chronicles 11:20-21 mentions "Maacah daughter of Absalom" as Rehoboam's favored wife. Many scholars identify this Maacah with Tamar, suggesting either a throne name or textual variation. This would mean Absalom's daughter entered the legitimate Davidic succession.</p>

          <p><strong>Note on Sources:</strong></p>
          <p>Due to the brief nature of biblical references to this Tamar, scholarship often discusses her in relation to her more prominent namesake aunt or within broader genealogical studies. The Maacah identification remains debated but has strong textual support.</p>
          <p><strong>Research Challenge:</strong> This profile required careful disambiguation from other Tamars and attention to Chronicles' genealogical theology to understand her significance.</p>
