    <!-- SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="themes-intro">
      <h3>Introduction: From Text to Life</h3>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> David's story is not merely ancient history but living Scripture that 
        shapes Christian discipleship, leadership, and worship. This page explores how the theological 
        themes embedded in David's narrative translate into practical wisdom for following Christ, 
        leading God's people, and cultivating intimacy with God through both triumph and failure.
      </div>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📖 Why David Still Matters</h4>
          <p>
            David occupies more narrative space in Scripture than any figure except Jesus. This isn't 
            accidental. His story integrates royal, prophetic, and priestly dimensions of covenant faith, 
            providing a lens for understanding:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Divine Election:</strong> How God chooses and calls the unlikely</li>
            <li><strong>Character Formation:</strong> Wilderness as crucible for leadership</li>
            <li><strong>Power & Accountability:</strong> The corruption of unchecked authority</li>
            <li><strong>Repentance & Restoration:</strong> Grace that transforms failure into testimony</li>
            <li><strong>Worship as Vocation:</strong> Leading through liturgy and presence</li>
            <li><strong>Messianic Hope:</strong> How human inadequacy points to Christ</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🎯 Application Framework</h4>
          <p>
            Each theme follows a three-part structure:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Biblical Foundation:</strong> Where the theme appears in David's story</li>
            <li><strong>Theological Significance:</strong> What the theme reveals about God and humanity</li>
            <li><strong>Practical Application:</strong> How the theme shapes contemporary Christian life</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            <strong>Interpretive Principle:</strong> David's life is both <em>descriptive</em> 
            (showing what happened) and <em>prescriptive</em> (teaching timeless truths). We learn 
            from his successes to emulate and his failures to avoid, while recognizing that his 
            ultimate function is <em>typological</em>—pointing beyond himself to Jesus, the faithful 
            Son of David who fulfills what David could not.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: THEME 1 - DIVINE ELECTION & REVERSAL -->

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📜 Biblical Foundation</h4>
          <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
            <strong>1 Samuel 16:7</strong> —
            <em>"But the LORD said to Samuel, 'Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, 
            because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, 
            but the LORD looks on the heart.'"</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            David's anointing embodies the biblical pattern of divine reversal: God chooses the overlooked, 
            the youngest, the shepherd rather than the warrior. This pattern appears throughout Scripture:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Abel over Cain (Gen 4)</li>
            <li>Isaac over Ishmael (Gen 21)</li>
            <li>Jacob over Esau (Gen 25)</li>
            <li>Joseph over his brothers (Gen 37)</li>
            <li>Ephraim over Manasseh (Gen 48)</li>
            <li><strong>David over his brothers (1 Sam 16)</strong></li>
            <li>Mary (humble servant) chosen to bear Messiah (Luke 1)</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Hannah's Song: Programmatic Theology</h5>
          <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
            <strong>1 Samuel 2:7-8</strong> —
            <em>"The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts. He raises up the poor 
            from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit 
            a seat of honor."</em>
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🔍 Theological Significance</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Grace, Not Merit:</strong> Election isn't reward for human qualification but 
            divine initiative rooted in God's sovereign love</li>
            <li><strong>Inner Reality Over Outward Appearance:</strong> God evaluates character, not 
            charisma; heart posture, not physical stature</li>
            <li><strong>Subversion of Power Structures:</strong> Kingdom values invert worldly hierarchies—
            first shall be last, lowly exalted</li>
            <li><strong>Dependence, Not Self-Sufficiency:</strong> Those chosen know they didn't earn it, 
            fostering humility and gratitude</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-Triumphalism:</strong> Success flows from divine favor, not human achievement</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>💡 Practical Application</h4>

          <h5>For Personal Discipleship</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Combat Comparison:</strong> If God chose David (youngest) over Eliab (oldest/tallest), 
            human metrics of success are irrelevant. Resist culture's obsession with credentials, appearance, 
            platform size</li>
            <li><strong>Cultivate Interior Life:</strong> God looks on the heart (לֵבָב)—invest in character 
            formation through spiritual disciplines (prayer, Scripture, solitude, confession)</li>
            <li><strong>Embrace Obscurity:</strong> David was anointed in private, reigned publicly years later. 
            Faithful obscurity prepares for fruitful influence</li>
            <li><strong>Trust Divine Timing:</strong> Resist pressure to force open doors. God exalts in his time</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>For Leadership</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Look Beyond Résumés:</strong> When identifying leaders, prioritize character over charisma, 
            faithfulness over flash</li>
            <li><strong>Create Space for the Overlooked:</strong> Intentionally platform voices from margins—women, 
            minorities, young adults</li>
            <li><strong>Name "Hidden Davids":</strong> Affirm potential in those others dismiss. Your "Samuel moment" 
            might unlock someone's calling</li>
            <li><strong>Reject Meritocracy:</strong> Organizations should reward character and service, not just 
            output or visibility</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="application-card" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <h5>🎯 Case Study: Modern Application</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Scenario:</strong> A church hiring committee debates between two pastoral candidates. Candidate A: 
          Ivy League education, previous megachurch experience, polished presentation. Candidate B: Small Bible college, 
          served faithfully in obscure rural church for 15 years, humble demeanor.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Davidic Wisdom:</strong> Don't default to impressive credentials. Interview deeply for character: 
          How does each handle criticism? What's their private prayer life? How do they treat "unimportant" people? 
          The "Candidate B" profile more closely mirrors David's shepherd-to-king trajectory. Eliab looked impressive 
          too—but God chose differently.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          <em>Note: This doesn't mean education or experience are irrelevant, but they're insufficient. Character is 
          non-negotiable; credentials are supplementary.</em>
        </p>
      </div>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📜 Biblical Foundation</h4>
          <p>
            The tension between David's covenant promise (2 Sam 7) and his covenant violation (2 Sam 11) 
            creates the Bible's most powerful exploration of grace:
          </p>

          <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
            <strong>2 Samuel 7:14-15</strong> —
            <em>"I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will 
            discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, but my steadfast love 
            will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you."</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This covenant contains both promise (eternal dynasty) and warning (discipline for sin). David's 
            adultery with Bathsheba and murder of Uriah test whether God's חֶסֶד (steadfast love) can survive 
            moral catastrophe.
          </p>

          <h5>Nathan's Confrontation & David's Response</h5>
          <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
            <strong>2 Samuel 12:13</strong> —
            <em>"David said to Nathan, 'I have sinned against the LORD.' And Nathan said to David, 
            'The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.'"</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Immediate confession. No defensiveness. No excuse-making. David models repentance that's:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Swift (no delay)</li>
            <li>Unqualified (no "but...I was under stress")</li>
            <li>God-directed ("against the LORD"—not just "I hurt Bathsheba/Uriah")</li>
            <li>Public (Psalm 51 becomes permanent record)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🔍 Theological Significance</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Forgiveness ≠ Immunity from Consequences:</strong> God forgives David ("you shall not die") 
            but consequences cascade—child dies, family violence erupts, Absalom rebels. Grace doesn't erase natural 
            outcomes of sin</li>
            <li><strong>Covenant Outlasts Failure:</strong> Despite David's sin, 2 Sam 7 promise endures. No human 
            failure cancels divine commitment</li>
            <li><strong>Moral Accountability for Leaders:</strong> Even anointed kings face prophetic confrontation. 
            Authority doesn't exempt from accountability</li>
            <li><strong>Repentance Restores Relationship, Not Just Status:</strong> David isn't merely forgiven 
            legally; he's restored to intimacy with God (Ps 51:10-12)</li>
            <li><strong>Intensifies Need for Sinless King:</strong> If David (man after God's heart) fails this 
            catastrophically, covenant requires a faithful Son of David who won't</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>💡 Practical Application</h4>

          <h5>For Personal Discipleship</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Own Sin Fully:</strong> Resist minimizing, rationalizing, or deflecting. Use David's language: 
            "I have sinned against the LORD" (not "mistakes were made")</li>
            <li><strong>Distinguish Guilt from Shame:</strong> Guilt says "I did wrong"; shame says "I am wrong." 
            David felt guilt (confessed); God responded with forgiveness. Shame keeps us hiding (Adam/Eve); grace 
            invites us into the light</li>
            <li><strong>Accept Consequences with Grace:</strong> David's child died despite repentance. Sometimes 
            forgiveness doesn't reverse earthly consequences. Trust God's bigger redemptive plan</li>
            <li><strong>Make Repentance Public When Sin Was Public:</strong> David's Psalm 51 became liturgy. 
            Private sins confessed privately; public sins require public accountability</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>For Leadership</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Create Confession-Safe Cultures:</strong> Organizations should reward transparency, not 
            punish honesty. If admitting failure = career death, people hide until exposed</li>
            <li><strong>Implement Accountability Structures:</strong> David had no one to say "no" when he wanted 
            Bathsheba. Leaders need peers who can confront, question, and check power</li>
            <li><strong>Model Repentance:</strong> When leaders fail, public confession (appropriate to the offense) 
            models how grace works. Hidden failures + public exposure = cynicism</li>
            <li><strong>Resist Restorative Timelines:</strong> David returned to worship quickly (2 Sam 12:20) but 
            family consequences persisted years. Restoration is process, not event. Don't rush wounded people back 
            to platform</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="application-card" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <h5>🎯 Case Study: Modern Application</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Scenario:</strong> A respected ministry leader admits to financial impropriety—embezzling funds 
          over several years. They confess publicly, resign, and express genuine remorse.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Davidic Wisdom:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Affirm Repentance:</strong> Confession is courageous. Celebrate it as first step</li>
          <li><strong>Enforce Consequences:</strong> Resignation appropriate. Legal/financial restitution necessary. 
          Like David, forgiveness doesn't erase accountability</li>
          <li><strong>Provide Pastoral Care:</strong> The person needs spiritual support, not just discipline. 
          Assign mentor, therapist, restoration pathway</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline Wisdom:</strong> Restoration to leadership (if ever appropriate) measured in years, 
          not months. David's family bore consequences lifelong. Trust rebuilds slowly</li>
          <li><strong>Community Response:</strong> Church should model grace without naivety—forgive personally while 
          maintaining institutional safeguards</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
          <em>Key Principle: Grace and accountability aren't opposites—they're partners. David experienced both 
          simultaneously.</em>

            <strong>2 Samuel 6:14-15, 18</strong> —
            <em>"And David danced before the LORD with all his might. And David was wearing a linen ephod. So David

          <p>
            David's ark procession (2 Sam 6) establishes him as <strong>priestly king</strong>—a fusion of roles 
            typically separated in Israel:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wears linen ephod:</strong> Priestly garment (Exod 28:6-14; 1 Sam 2:18)</li>
            <li><strong>Offers sacrifices:</strong> Every six steps (2 Sam 6:13)—priestly function</li>
            <li><strong>Blesses people:</strong> "In the name of the LORD"—priestly benediction</li>
            <li><strong>Distributes feast:</strong> Bread, meat, raisins—Edenic abundance/hospitality</li>
            <li><strong>Dances "with all his might":</strong> Unrestrained worship befitting the moment</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Psalm 110: Priest-King Enthronement</h5>
          <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
            <strong>Psalm 110:1, 4</strong> —
            <em>"The LORD says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'... 
            The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.'"</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This royal psalm canonizes what David's ark procession demonstrated: the Davidic king functions as 
            priest. "After the order of Melchizedek" (Gen 14:18) invokes pre-Israelite priest-king who blessed Abraham.

          <h4>🔍 Theological Significance</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Leadership = Worship Facilitation:</strong> David's primary role isn't military conquest 
            but bringing people into God's presence</li>
            <li><strong>King as Mediator:</strong> Priestly function is mediating between God and people—blessing, 
            interceding, representing both parties</li>
            <li><strong>Power Through Presence:</strong> David's authority flows from proximity to God (ark), 
            not military might</li>
            <li><strong>Worship as Political Act:</strong> Bringing ark to Jerusalem makes Zion both political 
            capital and worship center—inseparable spheres</li>
            <li><strong>Anticipates Christ:</strong> Jesus fulfills perfect priest-king (Heb 7-8)—mediates new 
            covenant, offers himself, blesses eternally</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>💡 Practical Application</h4>

          <h5>For Personal Discipleship</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Worship as Lifestyle:</strong> David didn't compartmentalize—shepherd, warrior, king, 
            psalmist formed integrated life. Resist sacred/secular split</li>
            <li><strong>Unrestrained Expression:</strong> David danced "with all his might," ignoring Michal's 
            contempt. Authentic worship transcends dignity-obsessed respectability</li>
            <li><strong>Cultivate Presence-Awareness:</strong> David organized life around ark (God's presence). 
            Modern equivalent: structure rhythms around prayer, Scripture, Sabbath</li>
            <li><strong>Music as Formation:</strong> David's psalms shaped Israel's worship vocabulary. What you 
            sing forms what you believe. Choose liturgy carefully</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>For Leadership</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lead Worship Before Leading Anything Else:</strong> David brought ark before conquering 
            enemies. Spiritual vitality precedes strategic planning</li>
            <li><strong>Model Vulnerability in Worship:</strong> Leaders who worship authentically (not performatively) 
            give permission for others to be real with God</li>
            <li><strong>Integrate Worship into Governance:</strong> Don't relegate worship to "spiritual" domain. 
            David's statecraft was liturgical—decisions made in presence of God</li>
            <li><strong>Create Worship Culture:</strong> David appointed musicians, established liturgy (1 Chr 23-25). 
            Worship doesn't happen accidentally—it requires intentional cultivation</li>
            <li><strong>Priest-King Mentality for Elders/Pastors:</strong> Shepherding = mediating God's presence 
            to people. Primary qualification isn't administrative skill but intimacy with God</li>
          </ul>

        <h5>🎯 Case Study: Modern Application</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Scenario:</strong> A business executive who's also a church elder struggles to integrate faith 
          and work. Sunday worship feels disconnected from Monday boardroom decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Davidic Wisdom:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Reject Compartmentalization:</strong> David didn't have "king David" vs. "worshiper David." 
          Same person in all contexts. Kingship <em>was</em> priestly function</li>
          <li><strong>Pray Before Decisions:</strong> David consulted God before battles (1 Sam 23:2, 4; 30:8). 
          Equivalent: pray before hiring, firing, strategic pivots</li>
          <li><strong>Bring "Ark" to "Jerusalem":</strong> Make workspace a place of presence—start meetings with 
          prayer, display Scripture, practice Sabbath from email</li>
          <li><strong>Bless Your "People":</strong> David blessed Israel (2 Sam 6:18). Modern leader: speak words 
          of life over employees, customers, stakeholders—not manipulatively but genuinely</li>
          <li><strong>Worship as Weekly Realignment:</strong> Use Sunday worship to recalibrate Monday priorities. 
          What you sing reshapes what you value</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
          <em>Key Principle: Every sphere of influence is opportunity for priestly mediation—bringing God's presence 
          into that space.</em>

            Psalm 51, David's response to Nathan's confrontation (2 Sam 12), becomes the Bible's paradigmatic 
            repentance prayer:
          </p>

          <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
            <strong>Psalm 51:1-4, 10-12</strong> —
            <em>"Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy 
            blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin! For I 
            know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done 
            what is evil in your sight... Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. 
            Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of 
            your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit."</em>
          </blockquote>

          <h5>Elements of True Repentance</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Appeal to Mercy (v. 1):</strong> No merit-based plea—pure dependence on God's חֶסֶד</li>
            <li><strong>Ownership of Sin (v. 3-4):</strong> "I know my transgressions...against you"—no deflection</li>
            <li><strong>Recognition of Depth (v. 5):</strong> "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity"—not just 
            actions but nature needs renewal</li>
            <li><strong>Request for Inner Transformation (v. 10):</strong> "Create" (בָּרָא)—only God can do this</li>
            <li><strong>Fear of Separation (v. 11):</strong> Worst consequence = loss of presence</li>
            <li><strong>Desire to Teach Others (v. 13):</strong> Restored sinner becomes witness</li>
            <li><strong>Worship Restoration (v. 14-15):</strong> Forgiveness reopens praise</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🔍 Theological Significance</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sin Defined Vertically:</strong> "Against you, you only" (v. 4)—though David wronged 
            Bathsheba/Uriah, sin is fundamentally against God</li>
            <li><strong>Grace Precedes Repentance:</strong> David appeals to God's character (mercy, steadfast love) 
            before confessing—trust in grace enables confession</li>
            <li><strong>Inner Transformation Required:</strong> "Create in me a clean heart"—external behavior change 
            insufficient without heart renewal</li>
            <li><strong>Presence Over Performance:</strong> David's greatest fear isn't punishment but exile from 
            God's presence (v. 11)</li>
            <li><strong>Failure Becomes Testimony:</strong> "Then I will teach transgressors" (v. 13)—restored 
            brokenness has unique ministry capacity</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>💡 Practical Application</h4>

          <h5>For Personal Discipleship</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Practice Psalm 51 Regularly:</strong> Use it as template for confession—not just "I'm sorry" 
            but deep engagement with mercy, cleansing, heart-renewal</li>
            <li><strong>Name Sin Specifically:</strong> David doesn't say "I made mistakes"—he says "adultery, murder." 
            Euphemisms prevent healing</li>
            <li><strong>Embrace "Create in Me":</strong> You can't self-improve into righteousness. Transformation 
            requires God's creative act (בָּרָא—same verb as Gen 1:1)</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Settle for Guilt Management:</strong> Goal isn't feeling bad enough—it's restored 
            intimacy ("restore to me the joy")</li>
            <li><strong>Let Brokenness Become Offering:</strong> "Broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not 
            despise" (v. 17)—your weakness, offered to God, has value</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>For Leadership & Pastoral Care</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Create Confession Pathways:</strong> Make it structurally easy to confess. Regular confession 
            liturgy, trained spiritual directors, accessible counseling</li>
            <li><strong>Normalize Repentance:</strong> Leaders who model confession destigmatize it. Share (appropriately) 
            your own need for grace</li>
            <li><strong>Distinguish Shame from Guilt:</strong> Guilt says "I did wrong" (healthy); shame says "I am 
            wrong" (toxic). Guide people from shame to grace-based guilt</li>
            <li><strong>Patience with Process:</strong> David's family suffered consequences for years. Restoration 
            isn't linear. Walk with people through long obedience</li>
            <li><strong>Commission Restored People:</strong> "Then I will teach transgressors your ways" (v. 13)—
            give restored people ministry roles. Their testimony is powerful</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="application-card" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <h5>🎯 Case Study: Modern Application</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Scenario:</strong> A young adult struggles with recurring porn addiction. They've confessed multiple 
          times, feel like they're disappointing God, and wonder if they should just give up on spiritual vitality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Davidic Wisdom:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Appeal to Mercy, Not Merit:</strong> Ps 51:1 doesn't say "I promise I'll be better"—it says 
          "according to your steadfast love." Even when you fail repeatedly, God's character doesn't change</li>
          <li><strong>Get to Root:</strong> David prays "create in me a clean heart." Porn is symptom of deeper 
          heart issue (loneliness? shame? fear?). Address root, not just behavior</li>
          <li><strong>Community Accountability:</strong> David had Nathan. You need someone who can ask hard questions 
          and speak truth. Isolation perpetuates cycles</li>
          <li><strong>Fear Right Thing:</strong> David's fear isn't "God will punish me" but "Cast me not away from 
          your presence." Cultivate desire for God himself, not just sin-avoidance</li>
          <li><strong>Long View:</strong> David's consequences lasted years (family violence). Healing is journey, 
          not event. Progress, not perfection</li>
          <li><strong>Future Witness:</strong> "Then I will teach transgressors" (v. 13). Your struggle, redeemed, 
          will help others. Don't waste your pain</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
          <em>Key Principle: Repentance is returning to the Father, not earning your way back. The prodigal son 
          prepared a speech; the father interrupted with embrace (Luke 15:20-24).</em>

            David's story deliberately creates <strong>positive and negative space</strong> for messianic expectation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive (What David Does):</strong> Defeats enemies, unifies nation, brings ark to Zion, 
            receives covenant, models shepherd-king leadership → job description for Messiah</li>
            <li><strong>Negative (What David Can't Do):</strong> Sins catastrophically, fails as intercessor, 
            leaves fractured family, dies → reveals need for sinless, perfect Son of David</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
            <strong>2 Samuel 7:12-16</strong> —
            <em>"When your days are fulfilled...I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from 
            your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish 
            the throne of his kingdom forever...And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. 
            Your throne shall be established forever."</em>
          </blockquote>

          <h5>The "Forever" Problem</h5>
          <p>
            The covenant says "forever" (עַד־עוֹלָם) three times (v. 13, 16), but:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>David dies (1 Kgs 2:10)</li>
            <li>Solomon sins (1 Kgs 11)</li>
            <li>Kingdom divides (1 Kgs 12)</li>
            <li>Babylon destroys Jerusalem (2 Kgs 25)</li>
            <li>No Davidic king for 500+ years</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This gap creates eschatological hunger: If God promised "forever," where's the fulfillment? Answer: 
            It's coming. The promise outlasts any particular king, pointing to <em>the</em> ultimate King.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>🔍 Theological Significance</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Human Inadequacy Points to Divine Solution:</strong> David's failure isn't narrative accident 
            but theological necessity. If even "man after God's heart" fails, we need God himself to become king</li>
            <li><strong>Covenant Patience:</strong> God's "forever" works on longer timeline than human lifespans. 
            Promises outlast disappointments</li>
            <li><strong>Typological Function:</strong> David is prototype—pattern sketched for later fulfillment. 
            Jesus doesn't replace David; he's what David pointed toward</li>
            <li><strong>Hope That Endures Exile:</strong> Even when monarchy ends (586 BCE), prophets keep promising 
            "a righteous Branch from David's line" (Jer 23:5)</li>
            <li><strong>NT Climax:</strong> Jesus is the "Son of David" who fulfills without failure—true shepherd, 
            sinless king, eternal priest, temple-builder</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>💡 Practical Application</h4>

          <h5>For Personal Discipleship</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Live "Not Yet" Expectantly:</strong> David's covenant teaches delayed fulfillment. Apply to 
            unanswered prayers—God's "yes" may be generations away from His "promise"</li>
            <li><strong>Let Disappointment Deepen Longing:</strong> David's failures intensify desire for Christ. 
            Similarly, your disappointments can refine hope—longing for ultimate King who won't fail</li>
            <li><strong>Trust Process, Not Perfection:</strong> David's complicated story (triumph + failure) is 
            Scripture's realism. Your story will be messy too. Trust God's narrative arc</li>
            <li><strong>Look to Jesus When Leaders Fail:</strong> Every human leader disappoints eventually. David's 
            story trains us not to idolize leaders but trust ultimate Leader</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>For Leadership & Pastoral Care</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Point People to Christ, Not Yourself:</strong> You're a flawed under-shepherd serving the 
            Chief Shepherd (1 Pet 5:4). Never let people think you're their messiah</li>
            <li><strong>Sustain Hope Through Failure:</strong> When ministries fail, marriages crumble, churches split—
            remember David's covenant endured worse. God's purposes survive human inadequacy</li>
            <li><strong>Teach Typology:</strong> Help people see how OT patterns (David, Moses, prophets) point to 
            Christ. This prevents both flat literalism and allegorizing disconnection</li>
            <li><strong>Embrace "Already/Not Yet":</strong> We live between Christ's first coming (David fulfilled) 
            and second coming (David consummated). Expect partial healing, incremental justice, gradual transformation</li>

        <h5>🎯 Case Study: Modern Application</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Scenario:</strong> A church experiences painful leadership crisis—beloved pastor admits affair, resigns 
          in disgrace. Congregation feels betrayed, questioning whether they can trust spiritual authority again.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Davidic Wisdom:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Don't Be Surprised:</strong> Even David (prototype faithful king) failed morally. Human leaders 
          will disappoint. This doesn't mean cynicism—it means realistic expectations</li>
          <li><strong>Grieve Without Despair:</strong> The church can lament betrayal (like Israel after David's sin) 
          while trusting God's bigger story continues</li>
          <li><strong>Recommit to True King:</strong> Use crisis to redirect hope from human leader to Christ. He's 
          the only leader who won't fail</li>
          <li><strong>Process with Realism:</strong> David's family bore consequences for years (Amnon, Absalom). 
          This church will need time to heal—months/years, not weeks</li>
          <li><strong>Find Way Forward:</strong> God didn't abandon Israel when David sinned. The covenant endured. 
          Similarly, God hasn't abandoned this church. Healing is possible</li>
          <li><strong>Learn Systemic Lessons:</strong> David had no accountability (could summon Bathsheba unchallenged). 
          Implement structures that prevent future abuse—mutual accountability, financial transparency, counseling 
          requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Key Takeaway for Leaders</h4>
        <p>
          David's path wasn't: <em>anointed → immediately king → lived happily ever after.</em> It was: 
          <em>anointed → wilderness → persecution → community-building → authority → failure → repentance → 
          restoration → generational investment.</em> Leadership formation is long, messy, painful, and glorious.

          <li><strong>Wilderness Seasons:</strong> Are you currently in a "wilderness" phase—waiting, tested, overlooked? 
          How might this season be forming you for future leadership (as it did for David)?</li>
          
          <li><strong>Power & Accountability:</strong> If you're in a position of authority, what safeguards do you have

          unqualified confession sound like for you right now?</li>
          
          <li><strong>Worship Integration:</strong> Is worship compartmentalized (Sunday-only) or integrated (whole-life)?

          <li><strong>Messianic Hope:</strong> What disappointments in human leadership (pastors, politicians, mentors) have

        <h4>👥 Group Discussion Questions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Reversal Principle:</strong> Why does God consistently choose "unlikely" people (David, Mary, disciples)? 
          What does this reveal about kingdom values vs. cultural values? How should this shape church leadership selection?</li>
          
          <li><strong>Failure & Grace:</strong> David was forgiven but faced consequences lifelong. How do we hold together 
          grace (forgiveness) and accountability (consequences)? Where do churches err—cheap grace or harsh legalism?</li>
          
          <li><strong>Priestly Leadership:</strong> What would it look like for elders/leaders to function as "priest-kings"—
          mediating God's presence, not just managing programs? How do we recover this vision?</li>

      <li><strong>Leadership Pipeline:</strong> Looking at the Davidic formation pattern (obscurity → testing → vindication →

  <div class="reflection-card" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
    <h4>📝 Practical Exercises</h4>
    
    <h5>Exercise 1: Psalm 51 Adaptation</h5>
    <p>
      Rewrite Psalm 51 in your own words, making it personal. Don't spiritualize or generalize—name specific sins, 
      appeal to specific attributes of God's character you're trusting. Pray it aloud daily for a week. Journal how 
      it shapes your prayer life.
    </p>

    <h5>Exercise 2: Leadership Inventory</h5>
    <p>
      Map your own leadership journey using the 10-phase Davidic pattern table (page section 7). Which phase are you 
      in currently? What's the lesson you're learning? Share with a mentor or peer for feedback.
    </p>

    <h5>Exercise 3: Typology Study</h5>
    <p>
      Choose one Davidic episode (Goliath, Bathsheba, Absalom's revolt, etc.). Read the original narrative. Then read 
      how NT authors reference or allude to it. Write a one-page reflection: How does Jesus fulfill or perfect this 
      pattern? What does this teach you about reading the Old Testament christologically?
    </p>

    <h5>Exercise 4: Accountability Audit</h5>
    <p>
      If you're in leadership, answer honestly:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <li>Who can question my decisions without losing their job/position?</li>
      <li>Who reviews my finances? My calendar? My digital life?</li>
      <li>If I were tempted to "Bathsheba moment," what structural safeguards exist?</li>
      <li>Do I have a "Nathan" who can say, "You are the man"?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If gaps exist, identify one concrete step to close them this month.
    </p>

    <h5>Exercise 5: Worship Audit</h5>
    <p>
      For one week, track when and how you worship:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <li>Formal (church services)</li>
      <li>Informal (music, prayer, Scripture reading)</li>
      <li>Integrated (thanksgiving during daily tasks, presence-awareness at work)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At week's end: Does your worship pattern look more like David (integrated, whole-life) or compartmentalized 
      (religious activity divorced from daily life)? What one change would move you toward integration?
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- SECTION 10: SYNTHESIS -->
<div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="synthesis">
  <h3>Synthesis: Living the Davidic Life</h3>

  <div class="key-insight">
    <strong>Summary Statement:</strong> David's story is not merely ancient history to admire but living pattern 
    to inhabit. The five themes explored—divine election, covenant faithfulness, priestly worship, repentance, 
    and messianic hope—form an integrated spirituality that shapes how we follow Christ, lead God's people, and 
    cultivate intimacy with God through both triumph and failure.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-2">
    <div>
      <h4>🌟 The Davidic Way: Integration</h4>
      <p>
        David's genius is integration—he doesn't compartmentalize shepherd, warrior, king, priest, psalmist, 
        sinner, penitent. These are facets of one life lived coram Deo (before the face of God). Modern 
        discipleship suffers from fragmentation: Sunday Christian, Monday professional, Wednesday small-group 
        participant, weekend athlete. David models wholeness.
      </p>

      <h5>Integration Looks Like:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Worship pervading work:</strong> Not just singing on Sunday but presence-awareness in 
        boardroom, classroom, kitchen</li>
        <li><strong>Vulnerability in leadership:</strong> Not hiding brokenness but letting Psalm 51 become 
        public record—modeling repentance</li>
        <li><strong>Justice & mercy held together:</strong> David administers righteousness (2 Sam 8:15) yet 
        shows חֶסֶד to Mephibosheth (ch. 9)—neither soft nor harsh</li>
        <li><strong>Dependence in strength:</strong> Even when king, David writes "LORD, you are my shepherd" 
        (Ps 23)—power doesn't negate need</li>
        <li><strong>Failure acknowledged, not denied:</strong> David's worst moments are canonized (2 Sam 11) 
        alongside his best—authenticity over image-management</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>✝️ From David to Jesus to Us</h4>
      <p>
        The movement of Scripture is: <strong>David → Christ → Church.</strong> What David embodied imperfectly, 
        Jesus perfects. What Jesus accomplishes, the Spirit replicates in us.
      </p>

      <h5>The Pattern Flows:</h5>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>David:</strong> Shepherd-king who integrates worship and rule, fails morally yet repents, 
        receives covenant promise of eternal throne</li>
        <li><strong>Jesus:</strong> Good Shepherd and King of kings who lives David's pattern perfectly—
        wilderness, anointing, persecution, vindication, priesthood, sacrifice—without sin. He IS the 
        eternal throne promised</li>
        <li><strong>Church:</strong> Called to royal priesthood (1 Pet 2:9), living stones in spiritual temple 
        (1 Pet 2:5), participating in Christ's Davidic kingship and priesthood through union with Him</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Practical Implication:</h5>
      <p class="small">
        You don't merely study David—you live Davidically by being "in Christ." His pattern becomes yours. 
        His failures warn you. His successes inspire you. His covenant promises secure you. His psalms give 
        you vocabulary. His messianic trajectory reminds you that your inadequacies point to Christ's sufficiency.

    <div style="background: #f8f3e6; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #7a5c2e; border-radius: 4px; font-style: italic;">
      <p>
        May you, like David, know yourself <strong>chosen</strong> by grace before you achieved anything—
        beloved because God is love, not because you earned it.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
        May your <strong>wilderness</strong> seasons form character that glittering platforms cannot, 
        preparing you for influence you cannot yet imagine.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
        May you lead through <strong>worship</strong>—bringing people into God's presence, not building 
        your kingdom—mediating grace like a priest-king.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
        When you fail (and you will), may you <strong>repent</strong> swiftly and fully, trusting God's 
        חֶסֶד (steadfast love) that forgives without erasing consequences, restoring without pretending it 
        didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
        May every human disappointment—failed leaders, broken systems, personal inadequacy—deepen your 
        <strong>hunger</strong> for Jesus, the faithful Son of David who reigns now and forever.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
        And may you, in Christ, participate in His eternal kingship and priesthood, living stones in the 
        temple He's building, bearing witness to the kingdom that has no end.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700; text-align: right;">
        In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.
      </p>
