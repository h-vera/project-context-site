    <!-- SECTION: REIGN OVERVIEW -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="reign-overview">
      <h3>Reign Overview</h3>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Scope:</strong> David's reign spans approximately 40 years (c. 1010–970 BCE), 
        divided between seven years ruling Judah from Hebron and thirty-three years ruling 
        all Israel from Jerusalem. His rule marks the transition from tribal confederation 
        to centralized monarchy and establishes the theological foundation for messianic expectation.
      </div>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📅 Chronological Framework</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Reign (Hebron):</strong> 2 Samuel 2–4 — Consolidates Judah while civil war continues with Saul's house</li>
            <li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> 2 Samuel 5–10 — Captures Jerusalem, brings the ark, receives covenant promise</li>
            <li><strong>Crisis & Consequences:</strong> 2 Samuel 11–20 — Bathsheba affair, Absalom's revolt, national fracture</li>
            <li><strong>Closing Acts:</strong> 2 Samuel 21–24; 1 Kings 1–2 — Epilogue narratives, succession struggles, final census</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🎭 Narrative Arc</h4>
          <p>
            David's reign follows a classic rise-fall-restoration pattern that mirrors humanity's 
            own journey. The narrative deliberately pairs his greatest achievements with his 
            deepest failures to demonstrate that even the "man after God's own heart" requires 
            a greater fulfillment of the covenant promise. This literary structure points 
            beyond David to a future Son of David who will reign without moral compromise.

    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="political-consolidation">
      <h3>Political Consolidation & Kingdom Building</h3>

      <div class="grid-3">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🏛️ Tribal Unification</h4>
          <p>
            David's capture of Jerusalem (2 Sam 5:6-10) was a masterstroke of political geography. 
            The Jebusite stronghold sat on the boundary between Judah and the northern tribes, 
            making it a neutral capital that belonged to no single tribe. This "City of David" 
            became the focal point for national unity, transforming a collection of loosely 
            affiliated clans into a cohesive kingdom.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel">
          <h4>⚔️ Military Campaigns</h4>
          <p>
            The victory lists in 2 Samuel 8 and 10 document David's systematic subjugation 
            of surrounding nations: Philistines, Moabites, Edomites, Ammonites, and Arameans. 
            These campaigns secured Israel's borders and established a brief empire that 
            controlled key trade routes. The "mighty men" tradition (2 Sam 23:8-39) 
            reveals David's reliance on a professional warrior class loyal to him personally.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel">
          <h4>⚖️ Administrative Structure</h4>
          <p>
            2 Samuel 8:15-18 presents David's cabinet: Joab (army commander), Jehoshaphat 
            (recorder), Zadok and Abiathar (priests), Seraiah (secretary). This bureaucratic 
            machinery mirrors the administrative systems of neighboring kingdoms and marks 
            Israel's transition from tribal governance to centralized monarchy. The text notes 
            significantly: "David administered justice and righteousness to all his people."
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="significance">
        <h4>The Jerusalem Strategy</h4>
        <p>
          David's choice of Jerusalem as capital had profound theological implications. 
          The city's location on a high mountain echoed Eden's elevated garden and anticipated 
          the cosmic mountain where heaven and earth would meet. By bringing the ark to Jerusalem 
          (2 Sam 6), David deliberately merged political and religious centers, positioning himself 
          as both king and priestly mediator. This move transformed Zion into the focal point 
          of Israel's worship and national identity.

    <!-- SECTION: PRIESTLY KINGSHIP -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="priestly-kingship">
      <h3>Priestly Kingship & the Ark Procession</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>2 Samuel 6:14-15</strong> — 
        <em>"And David danced before the LORD with all his might. And David was wearing a linen ephod. 
        So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with 
        the sound of the horn."</em>
      </blockquote>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🕊️ The Linen Ephod</h4>
          <p>
            David's deliberate choice to wear the linen ephod—the priestly garment specified 
            in Exodus 28—was no accident. By dressing as high priest during the ark's 
            procession, David claimed a role that traditionally belonged to Aaron's line. 
            This priestly-royal fusion recalls Melchizedek, the priest-king of Salem 
            (Jerusalem's predecessor) who blessed Abraham in Genesis 14.
          </p>
          <p>
            The narrator emphasizes David's actions: he offers sacrifices (v. 13), blesses 
            the people in Yahweh's name (v. 18), and distributes the feast (v. 19). These 
            are quintessentially priestly functions. David is not usurping the Levitical 
            priesthood but embodying a more ancient model of priest-kingship that predates 
            Israel's cultic system.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>✨ Theological Significance</h4>
          <p>
            The ark procession establishes Jerusalem as the new Eden—a space where God's 
            presence dwells among his people. The text repeatedly uses "seventh" imagery: 
            they sacrificed every six paces (v. 13), and the word "ark" appears seven times 
            in the chapter. This deliberate sabbath structuring signals creation-blessing 
            and cosmic rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            David's ecstatic dancing "before the LORD with all his might" demonstrates 
            unrestrained worship befitting the occasion. His wife Michal's contempt (v. 16) 
            represents the old order's rejection of this new priestly model. Her subsequent 
            barrenness symbolizes the sterility of Saul's house and the fruitfulness of 
            David's covenant line.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> David's priestly actions on Zion deliberately 
        echo Moses on Sinai and anticipate Psalm 110's declaration: "You are a priest forever 
        according to the order of Melchizedek." This moment establishes the theological grammar 
        for understanding Jesus as both Son of David and eternal High Priest (Hebrews 7).
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION: THE DAVIDIC COVENANT -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="davidic-covenant">
      <h3>The Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7)</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>2 Samuel 7:11b-16</strong> — 
        <em>"Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house. When your days 
        are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, 
        who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for 
        my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to him a father, 
        and he shall be to me a son... And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever 
        before me. Your throne shall be established forever."</em>
      </blockquote>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🏠 House Wordplay (בַּיִת)</h4>
          <p>
            The chapter turns on an exquisite wordplay: David wants to build Yahweh a 
            house (temple), but Yahweh reverses it—he will build David a house (dynasty). 
            The Hebrew word <em>bayit</em> (בַּיִת) means both "physical structure" and 
            "family/household." This double meaning becomes the theological hinge of the 
            entire narrative.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>v. 2:</strong> David dwells in a house of cedar</li>
            <li><strong>v. 5:</strong> Will you build me a house to dwell in?</li>
            <li><strong>v. 11:</strong> The LORD will make you a house</li>
            <li><strong>v. 13:</strong> He shall build a house for my name</li>
            <li><strong>v. 16:</strong> Your house shall be made sure forever</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>👑 Royal Sonship Formula</h4>
          <p>
            "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son" (v. 14) establishes 
            the adoption formula that becomes central to royal ideology. This father-son 
            language echoes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Psalm 2:7:</strong> "You are my Son; today I have begotten you"</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 89:26-27:</strong> "He shall cry to me, 'You are my Father'... 
            I will make him the firstborn"</li>
            <li><strong>2 Samuel 7:14:</strong> Includes discipline—"When he commits iniquity, 
            I will discipline him"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This covenant is both unconditional (dynasty assured) and conditional (individual 
            kings may be judged). The tension between promise and performance drives the 
            entire narrative forward.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="significance">
        <h4>Canonical Impact</h4>
        <p>
          2 Samuel 7 becomes the theological spine of the Hebrew Bible. Every subsequent 
          king is measured against this standard. The prophets (Isaiah 9, 11; Jeremiah 23; 
          Ezekiel 34) reinterpret it when the monarchy fails. The Psalms (2, 72, 89, 110, 132) 
          liturgize it. The New Testament identifies Jesus as its ultimate fulfillment 
          (Luke 1:32-33; Acts 2:30-36; Hebrews 1:5).
        </p>
        <p>
          The covenant's "forever" (עַד־עוֹלָם) language creates eschatological momentum: 
          no historical king fully satisfies these terms, so the promise perpetually points 
          forward to a coming ideal David who will.
        </p>

    <!-- SECTION: COVENANT KINDNESS (CHESED) -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="covenant-kindness">
      <h3>Covenant Kindness: Mephibosheth (2 Samuel 9)</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>2 Samuel 9:6-7</strong> — 
        <em>"And Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face 
        and paid homage. And David said, 'Mephibosheth!' And he answered, 'Behold, I am your servant.' 
        And David said to him, 'Do not fear, for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father 
        Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your father, and you shall eat at my 
        table always.'"</em>
      </blockquote>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🤝 Covenant Loyalty (חֶסֶד)</h4>
          <p>
            David's treatment of Mephibosheth exemplifies <em>chesed</em> (חֶסֶד)—covenant 
            loyalty, steadfast love, faithful kindness. This Hebrew term encompasses more 
            than mere mercy; it denotes committed allegiance that persists despite circumstances. 
            David shows <em>chesed</em> to Mephibosheth for three reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Covenant with Jonathan:</strong> They had sworn mutual <em>chesed</em> 
            (1 Sam 20:14-17)</li>
            <li><strong>Political restraint:</strong> Royal dynasties typically eliminated rivals; 
            David does the opposite</li>
            <li><strong>Divine pattern:</strong> David models Yahweh's own <em>chesed</em> toward 
            his covenant people</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>♿ Reversal of Fortunes</h4>
          <p>
            Mephibosheth ("he who scatters shame") was crippled in both feet—a detail emphasized 
            to show his vulnerability and dependence. As Saul's grandson, he represented potential 
            threat to David's throne. Yet David:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Restores Saul's estate to him (v. 7)</li>
            <li>Gives him a place at the king's table permanently (v. 7, 11, 13)</li>
            <li>Assigns Ziba's household to serve him (v. 9-10)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The phrase "ate at the king's table" signifies royal adoption. Mephibosheth transitions 
            from fugitive to family—a portrait of grace that transcends justice.
          </p>

</div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Layering:</strong> This chapter bridges David's covenant blessing 
        (ch. 7) and his covenant betrayal (ch. 11). It demonstrates the king's capacity for 
        <em>chesed</em> when functioning as God's image, while foreshadowing the <em>chesed</em> 
        David will desperately need when he himself becomes the covenant-breaker. The narrative 
        architecture is pointing toward One who shows <em>chesed</em> perfectly—drawing enemies 
        to feast at his table (Luke 15:2; 22:14-20).

    <!-- SECTION: MORAL COLLAPSE -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="moral-collapse">
      <h3>Moral Collapse & Consequences (2 Samuel 11-12)</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>2 Samuel 11:1</strong> — 
        <em>"In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, 
        and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. 
        But David remained at Jerusalem."</em>
      </blockquote>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🏔️ The Garden on the Roof</h4>
          <p>
            The Hebrew word for "roof" (גָּג <em>gag</em>) is spelled with letters nearly 
            identical to "garden" (גָּן <em>gan</em>). This wordplay is intentional: David 
            is on his cosmic mountain, Jerusalem-Zion, in a garden-like space. The scene 
            deliberately echoes Genesis 3:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>He saw</strong> (v. 2) — like Eve saw the tree was good for food</li>
            <li><strong>Very beautiful to look at</strong> — language of visual desire 
            (Gen 3:6; 6:2)</li>
            <li><strong>He took her</strong> (v. 4) — the verb "take" (לָקַח) recalls 
            "took and ate" (Gen 3:6)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            David's test on the mountain mirrors Adam's test in the garden. At the height 
            of his priestly-kingly authority, he seizes what appears good in his eyes rather 
            than trusting God's provision.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Nathan's Confrontation</h4>
          <p>
            Nathan's parable (2 Sam 12:1-7) is prophetic genius. The story of a rich man 
            stealing a poor man's lamb allows David to pronounce judgment on himself: 
            "As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die" (v. 5). 
            Nathan's response—"You are the man!"—unmasks David's self-deception.
          </p>
          <p>
            God's verdict comes in two parts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Grace:</strong> "The LORD has put away your sin; you shall not die" (v. 13)</li>
            <li><strong>Consequence:</strong> "The sword shall never depart from your house" (v. 10)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            David is forgiven but not exempted from the ripple effects of his actions. 
            The child conceived in adultery dies (v. 18), and David's own household will 
            replicate his sins: Amnon rapes Tamar (ch. 13), Absalom murders Amnon (ch. 13), 
            Absalom revolts and lies with David's concubines (ch. 16).

        <h4>Theological Implications</h4>
        <p>
          This narrative challenges triumphalist readings of kingship. Even the covenant bearer 
          can become covenant breaker. David's failure reveals:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Power corrupts:</strong> Kingship without moral restraint leads to tyranny</li>
          <li><strong>Grace persists:</strong> God's commitment to the covenant outlasts human failure</li>
          <li><strong>Justice costs:</strong> Forgiveness doesn't erase consequences—generational 
          pain follows sin</li>
          <li><strong>Typological necessity:</strong> If David can't be the faithful Son, the covenant 
          requires another</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Psalm 51, David's penitential prayer, becomes the paradigm for post-sin restoration. 
          Yet the narrative never allows us to forget: this man murdered an innocent soldier 
          to cover his adultery. The juxtaposition of divine mercy and human wickedness creates 
          theological tension that only the gospel can resolve.

      <h3>The Failed Intercessor on Mount Zion (2 Samuel 24)</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>2 Samuel 24:17</strong> — 
        <em>"Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking the people, 
        and said, 'Behold, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly. But these sheep, what have

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Context:</strong> This story, drawn from Bible Project's study "David, the Failed 
        Intercessor on Mount Zion," reveals the deepest irony of David's reign. At the place that 
        will become the temple mount—the ultimate site of atonement—David's own failure 
        necessitates a substitute sacrifice.
      </div>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📊 The Census Crisis</h4>
          <p>
            The chapter opens with an enigmatic line: "Again the anger of the LORD burned against 
            Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, 'Go, number Israel and Judah'" 
            (v. 1). The word "again" hyperlinks to the pattern in Judges where God's anger burned 
            due to idolatry, and he handed Israel to their enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's the twist: instead of foreign enemies, David himself becomes the instrument 
            of judgment. Taking a military census demonstrates trust in numerical strength rather 
            than Yahweh's deliverance—the very mistake Israel was warned against (Deut 17:16; 
            Psalm 20:7). Joab recognizes this and protests (v. 3), but David insists.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>☠️ Plague and Choice</h4>
          <p>
            After the census, David's conscience strikes him (v. 10). God offers three punishments: 
            seven years of famine, three months of military defeat, or three days of plague (v. 13). 
            David chooses plague, saying, "Let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is 
            great; but let me not fall into the hand of man" (v. 14).
          </p>
          <p>
            But his choice is self-preserving. Plague falls on the people—70,000 die (v. 15)—while 
            David remains safe in his palace. He has become the anti-Moses, the anti-intercessor. 
            Where Moses offered his life for Israel's sin (Exod 32:32), David chooses his people's 
            suffering over his own.

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🏔️ Threshing Floor Geography</h4>
          <p>
            The plague stops at "the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite" (v. 16). This detail 
            is loaded with significance:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Threshing floor</strong> (גֹּרֶן <em>goren</em>) echoes "garden" (גָּן <em>gan</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Araunah</strong> (אֲרַוְנָה) is spelled with the same letters as "ark" (אֲרוֹן)</li>
            <li><strong>Jebusite</strong> — a Canaanite remnant, recalling Jerusalem's pre-Israelite past</li>
            <li><strong>High place</strong> — Araunah "looked down" (v. 20), indicating elevation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is Mount Moriah, where Abraham nearly sacrificed Isaac (Gen 22). The narrator 
            wants us to see the connection: another father, another sacrifice, another divine intervention.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🔥 Altar and Atonement</h4>
          <p>
            Araunah offers to give David everything needed for sacrifice (v. 22-23), but David 
            refuses: "I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing" 
            (v. 24). He buys the threshing floor and offers sacrifices. "And the LORD responded 
            to the plea for the land, and the plague was averted from Israel" (v. 25).
          </p>
          <p>
            David finally acts as intercessor, but only by paying for a substitute. His own life 
            can't atone—he's the one who sinned. So God accepts the blameless animals in his place. 
            This threshing floor becomes the site of Solomon's temple (2 Chr 3:1), forever linking 
            David's failure with the need for ongoing sacrifice.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Narrative Function:</strong> This story is deliberately placed as the last major 
        episode in Samuel. David is a failure at the deepest level—he cannot be the true intercessor 
        his people need. Yet the very place of his failure becomes the site of God's dwelling. 
        The temple will rise where David fell short, pointing forward to One who will succeed where 
        David failed: a priest-king who offers himself as the sacrifice (Hebrews 9:11-14).

        <strong>The Davidic Paradox:</strong> David is simultaneously "a man after God's own heart" 
        (1 Sam 13:14; Acts 13:22) and a murderous adulterer whose family descends into chaos. This 
        tension is not a narrative accident but a deliberate theological move. David's reign 
        establishes the grammar of righteous kingship while simultaneously demonstrating that no 
        human king can fulfill it. He is both prototype and problem—the pattern of what kingship 
        should be and the proof that it requires divine fulfillment.

    <!-- SECTION: CHRONICLES' IDEALIZED DAVID -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="chronicles-david">
      <h3>Chronicles' Idealized Portrait</h3>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📖 A Different Telling</h4>
          <p>
            When the Chronicler retells David's story (1 Chronicles 10–29), he makes striking 
            editorial choices. Bathsheba is never mentioned. Absalom's revolt disappears. The 
            family violence and political intrigue evaporate. What remains is David the temple 
            organizer, the worship architect, the model king.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not historical whitewashing but theological recalibration. Writing after 
            exile, the Chronicler addresses a community asking: "Should we still hope in David's 
            line? Does the covenant still stand?" His answer: Yes—focus on David's heart for 
            God's house and worship, not his personal failures.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🎵 Temple Preparation Emphasis</h4>
          <p>
            Chronicles dedicates extensive space to David's preparations for the temple 
            (1 Chr 22–29):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Material gathering:</strong> Stockpiles bronze, iron, cedar, stone (22:2-5)</li>
            <li><strong>Levitical organization:</strong> Assigns temple duties by divisions (23–26)</li>
            <li><strong>Musical worship:</strong> Appoints singers, musicians, gatekeepers (25)</li>
            <li><strong>Financial pledges:</strong> Personal and tribal offerings for construction (29:1-9)</li>
            <li><strong>Solomon's commissioning:</strong> Public transfer of responsibility (28:1-10)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            David becomes a second Moses, delivering blueprints received "by the Spirit" 
            (28:12, 19) to his Joshua-like successor.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="significance">
        <h4>Post-Exilic Function</h4>
        <p>
          Chronicles' David serves a specific pastoral purpose for Second Temple Judaism. 
          After Babylonian exile ended monarchy, the community needed a vision of restored 
          Davidic kingship that focused on worship rather than political power. The Chronicler's 
          portrait says:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>David's true legacy is the temple and worship he enabled</li>
          <li>The covenant promise survives despite dynastic failure</li>
          <li>Future hope centers on a David-like figure who will rebuild temple and worship</li>
          <li>Personal piety and heart for God's house matter more than military prowess</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This "ideal David" shapes how later Judaism imagined the Messiah: not as warrior-king 
          but as restorer of true worship. When Jesus cleanses the temple (Mark 11:15-18) and 
          calls himself "greater than the temple" (Matt 12:6), he's drawing on this Chronicler's 
          vision.

      <h3>Synthesis: The Reign That Points Beyond Itself</h3>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Narrative Architecture:</strong> David's reign is deliberately structured to create 
        theological tension. His successes establish the pattern of ideal kingship—shepherd-warrior, 
        covenant-bearer, priestly mediator, justice administrator. His failures expose the limits 
        of human kingship and necessitate a greater fulfillment. This dual movement is not narrative 
        contradiction but prophetic design.

        <div>
          <h4>🔮 What David Anticipated</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A king who won't murder to preserve his dynasty</li>
            <li>A shepherd who won't harm his own flock (24:17)</li>
            <li>An intercessor who can actually atone for sins</li>
            <li>A priest-king whose worship is undefiled by moral compromise</li>
            <li>A son of David who perfectly embodies sonship to God</li>
            <li>A covenant-bearer who fulfills rather than breaks covenant terms</li>
            <li>A temple-builder whose house is his own body (John 2:19-21)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="significance">
        <h4>The Messianic Trajectory</h4>
        <p>
          David's reign generates what might be called "positive and negative space" in messianic 
          expectation. Positively, his successes create the job description: the Messiah must be 
          shepherd-king, covenant-bearer, priestly mediator, justice-bringer, temple-builder. 
          Negatively, his failures create the moral requirement: the Messiah must be what David 
          couldn't be—sinless, faithful, truly intercessory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prophets pick up this dual legacy. Isaiah 9 and 11 envision a Davidic king who 
          reigns with perfect wisdom and justice. Jeremiah 23 speaks of a "righteous Branch" from 
          David's line who will "execute justice and righteousness." Ezekiel 34 promises a 
          shepherd-king "David" who will truly care for the flock. Zechariah 6:12-13 describes 
          one who will build the temple and "be a priest on his throne."
        </p>
        <p>
          The New Testament claims Jesus is this figure. He is born in David's city (Luke 2:4, 11), 
          from David's line (Matt 1:1; Rom 1:3), and proclaimed "Son of David" (Matt 9:27; 20:30-31). 
          He enters Jerusalem as king (Matt 21:9), yet redefines kingship through crucifixion 
          (John 19:19-22). His resurrection enthrones him at God's right hand (Acts 2:34-36), 
          fulfilling Psalm 110. His eternal priesthood (Heb 7:17, 21) accomplishes what David's 
          substitutes could not—perfect atonement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Final Verdict:</strong> David's reign succeeds as prophecy precisely where it fails 
        as history. His political achievements establish the form; his moral failures establish the 
        need. Together they point compellingly beyond themselves to One who will be "son of David" 
        without David's sin, "priest forever" without priestly failure, and eternal king whose 
        throne never falls to corruption. That is the genius of the David narrative—it plants hope 
        by showing us both the pattern and the problem, trusting God to provide the solution.
