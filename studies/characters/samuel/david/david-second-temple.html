      <h3>Introduction: Bridging Testament & Temple</h3>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Historical Context:</strong> When Babylon destroyed Jerusalem in 586 BCE, the Davidic monarchy ended. 
        No descendant of David sat on a throne for over 500 years. Yet Davidic hope didn't die—it transformed. 
        Second Temple Judaism (c. 515 BCE – 70 CE) reimagined the covenant promise as eschatological expectation, 
        and the New Testament proclaimed that expectation fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth.

          <h4>🔄 Transformation Pattern</h4>
          <p>
            Second Temple Judaism navigated a painful tension: How do you maintain hope in 
            Davidic promises when there's no Davidic king? The response was creative reinterpretation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>From Political to Eschatological:</strong> The "Son of David" shifted from 
            present ruler to future deliverer</li>
            <li><strong>From National to Cosmic:</strong> Expectations expanded beyond Israel's 
            borders to universal restoration</li>
            <li><strong>From Dynastic to Individual:</strong> Focus narrowed to "the" coming one 
            rather than a continuing line</li>
            <li><strong>From Military to Moral:</strong> Victory over enemies became victory over 
            sin and evil</li>
            <li><strong>From Temple to Presence:</strong> God's dwelling expanded beyond physical 
            structure to renewed creation</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            The New Testament authors claimed Jesus embodied all these transformations. He was:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The eschatological Son of David appearing in history</li>
            <li>The cosmic king whose reign transcends ethnic boundaries</li>
            <li>The singular Messiah, not one of many Davidic rulers</li>
            <li>The moral victor who defeats sin through sacrifice</li>
            <li>The true temple—God's presence incarnate</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="key-insight">
          <strong>Context:</strong> Written during Roman occupation, Psalms of Solomon critiques 
          both Roman oppressors and corrupt Hasmonean rulers. Psalm 17 articulates intense longing 
          for a righteous Davidic king who will purge Jerusalem and restore justice.

            <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
              <strong>Psalms of Solomon 17:21-25</strong> —
              <em>"See, Lord, and raise up for them their king, the son of David, to rule over 
              your servant Israel in the time known to you, O God. Undergird him with the strength 
              to destroy the unrighteous rulers, to purge Jerusalem from gentiles who trample her

            <h5>Theological Elements</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Son of David Title:</strong> Explicit messianic designation linking 
              to 2 Samuel 7 covenant</li>
              <li><strong>Purification Mission:</strong> Will cleanse Jerusalem of foreign 
              occupation and internal corruption</li>
              <li><strong>Wisdom & Righteousness:</strong> Rules through Spirit-empowered justice, 
              echoing Isaiah 11</li>
              <li><strong>Non-Military Victory:</strong> "He will not rely on horse and rider 
              and bow" (17:33)—trust in God</li>
              <li><strong>Universal Scope:</strong> Gentile nations submit; judgment extends 
              to all peoples</li>
              <li><strong>Sinless Ruler:</strong> "No unrighteousness among them in his days"—
              perfect moral standard</li>
              <li><strong>"Lord Messiah":</strong> Title combining divine authority with Davidic anointing</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>NT Resonance</h5>
            <p class="small">
              Jesus' ministry both fulfills and subverts these expectations. He is Son of David 
              (Matt 1:1; Luke 1:32) who purifies temple (Mark 11:15-17), brings righteousness 
              (Rom 5:17-19), and draws nations to himself (John 12:32). Yet he redefines victory 
              through cross rather than conquest, making "purging Jerusalem" about cleansing hearts 
              not expelling Romans.

        <h4>📖 4QFlorilegium (Qumran, mid-1st century BCE)</h4>

        <div class="grid-2">
          <div>
            <h5>Document Description</h5>
            <p>
              4QFlorilegium (4Q174) is a Dead Sea Scroll that interprets 2 Samuel 7:11-14 alongside 
              other texts. It represents sectarian interpretation of Davidic promises at Qumran, 
              showing how the community expected two messiahs: a royal Davidic figure and a priestly 
              Aaronic figure.
            </p>

            <h5>Key Interpretation</h5>
            <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
              <strong>4Q174 frg. 1, col. 1, lines 10-13</strong> —
              <em>"[This refers to the] Branch of David, who will arise with the Interpreter of 
              the Law who [will rise up] in Zi[on in] the last days... He is the Branch of David 
              who will arise at the end [of days]."</em>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              The text links 2 Sam 7:11-14 ("I will raise up your seed") with Amos 9:11 ("I will 
              raise up the booth of David") and identifies "the Branch of David" as the eschatological 
              king who partners with a priestly "Interpreter of the Law."
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Theological Innovations</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Eschatological Temple:</strong> Interprets 2 Sam 7:13 ("He shall build 
              a house for my name") as future eschatological sanctuary</li>
              <li><strong>Branch Identification:</strong> Uses prophetic "Branch" language (Jer 23:5; 
              Zech 3:8) for Davidic Messiah</li>
              <li><strong>Dual Messianic Expectation:</strong> Royal + priestly figures working 
              together</li>
              <li><strong>Last Days Focus:</strong> Davidic promises deferred to apocalyptic climax</li>
              <li><strong>Torah Centrality:</strong> Messiah linked with proper interpretation/teaching 
              of Law</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>NT Contrast</h5>
            <p class="small">
              Unlike Qumran's two-messiah model, the NT presents Jesus as singular Messiah who 
              combines royal and priestly offices in one person (Heb 7:17, 21 citing Ps 110:4). 
              He is both "Son of David" (royal) and "priest forever" (priestly), collapsing the 
              expectation into incarnate unity.

            <h5>Praise of David</h5>
            <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
              <strong>Sirach 47:2, 8-11</strong> —
              <em>"As the fat is selected from the peace offering, so David was selected from the 
              sons of Israel... In all his works he gave thanks to the Holy One, the Most High, 
              with words of praise. With his whole heart he sang hymns and loved his Maker. He 
              placed singers before the altar to make sweet melody with their voices... The Lord 
              took away his sins and exalted his horn forever; he gave him the covenant of kings 
              and a glorious throne in Israel."</em>
            </blockquote>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Emphases in Sirach</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Worship Leadership:</strong> David as organizer of temple music and liturgy</li>
              <li><strong>Forgiven Sinner:</strong> Acknowledges sin (Bathsheba implied) yet celebrates 
              God's forgiveness</li>
              <li><strong>Covenant Permanence:</strong> Despite failure, "covenant of kings" endures</li>
              <li><strong>Model King:</strong> Example of piety, musical skill, military courage</li>
              <li><strong>Canonical Bridge:</strong> Connects pre-exilic memory to post-exilic hope</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
              Sirach's David is neither whitewashed (sin acknowledged) nor condemned (forgiveness 
              emphasized). This balanced portrait sustains hope: if God could work through flawed 
              David, the covenant promise remains trustworthy.

            <h5>Targum Interpretive Additions</h5>
            <p>
              The Targums (Aramaic paraphrases of Hebrew Scripture) insert explicit messianic

            </blockquote>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Interpretive Strategy</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Messiah King:</strong> Inserts "King Messiah" as interpretive gloss</li>
              <li><strong>Eschatological War:</strong> Expands battle imagery as end-times conflict</li>
              <li><strong>Priestly Elements:</strong> Acknowledges Melchizedek priesthood as messianic</li>
              <li><strong>Divine Authority:</strong> Clarifies that kingship comes from God's decree</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>NT Parallel</h5>
            <p class="small">
              Jesus and NT authors perform similar interpretive moves—reading royal psalms as 
              messianic prophecy. When Jesus asks, "How can the Messiah be David's son if David 
              calls him Lord?" (Mark 12:35-37, citing Ps 110:1), he's drawing on this tradition 
              of pesher-style interpretation.

      <h3>New Testament Transformation Techniques</h3>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Hermeneutical Shift:</strong> The NT doesn't simply quote David texts—it transforms them. 
        What was historical becomes eschatological, what was national becomes universal, what was 
        political becomes spiritual. Yet the continuity remains: Jesus is genuinely David's heir, 
        fulfilling promises made centuries earlier.

        <div class="grid-2">
          <div>
            <h5>Technique Explained</h5>
            <p>
              Second Temple texts projected Davidic fulfillment into the distant future—"in the 
              last days," "at the end of time." NT authors boldly claim these promises are fulfilled 
              <em>now</em> in Jesus' ministry, death, and resurrection. The eschatological breaks 
              into history; the "not yet" becomes inaugurated "already."

            <h5>Theological Effect</h5>
            <p>
              By collapsing future into present, the NT declares the "age to come" has invaded 
              this age. The Davidic kingdom is no longer postponed hope but inaugurated reality. 
              This creates the "already/not yet" tension of NT eschatology—the kingdom is here 
              (in Jesus) but not fully consummated.
            </p>

            <p class="small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
              Peter interprets resurrection as enthronement. What Psalm 110 anticipated abstractly, 
              Jesus' rising accomplishes concretely. The eschatological Son of David is seated on 
              the throne <em>right now</em>.

            <h5>Technique Explained</h5>
            <p>
              Davidic promises were ethnically focused—a king for <em>Israel</em>, ruling from 
              <em>Jerusalem</em>. The NT universalizes these: Jesus reigns over Jews and Gentiles, 
              from heavenly Zion, extending David's kingdom to "the ends of the earth." Geographic 
              and ethnic boundaries dissolve without abandoning Israel's story.

            <h5>Theological Effect</h5>
            <p>
              The expansion isn't replacement but fulfillment. Israel's promises become the world's 
              blessings <em>through</em> Israel's Messiah. Jesus doesn't stop being Jewish or Davidic; 
              rather, his Jewishness becomes the conduit for universal salvation. As Paul argues in 
              Romans 15:8-12, Christ became "a servant to the circumcised...in order that the Gentiles 
              might glorify God."
            </p>

            <h5>Case Study: Acts 15 Jerusalem Council</h5>
            <p>
              When debating Gentile inclusion, James quotes Amos 9:11-12:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
              <strong>Acts 15:16-17</strong> —
              <em>"After this I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; 
              I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, that the remnant of mankind may seek 
              the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name."</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The "rebuilding of David's tent" = Gentiles entering the kingdom. What Amos envisioned 
              as national restoration becomes ethnic inclusion. The Davidic kingdom now encompasses 
              "all the Gentiles who are called by my name."

        <div class="grid-2">
          <div>
            <h5>Technique Explained</h5>
            <p>
              The most radical NT move is identifying Jesus not merely as covenant <em>recipient</em> 
              but covenant <em>embodiment</em>. He doesn't just receive Davidic promises—he <em>is</em> 
              the promise. Abstract covenant language becomes incarnate person.
            </p>

            <h5>Examples</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>2 Sam 7:14 → Heb 1:5:</strong> Sonship formula applied ontologically—
              Jesus is God's Son by nature, not just adoption</li>
              <li><strong>Ps 89:27 → Col 1:15, 18:</strong> "Firstborn" becomes "firstborn of 
              all creation" and "firstborn from the dead"</li>
              <li><strong>Hosea 11:1 → Matt 2:15:</strong> "Out of Egypt I called my son" 
              (originally Israel) now Jesus recapitulating Israel's story</li>
              <li><strong>Zech 6:12 → John 2:19-21:</strong> "He shall build the temple" = 
              Jesus' risen body as new temple</li>
              <li><strong>Jer 31:31 → Luke 22:20:</strong> "This cup is the new covenant in 
              my blood"—Jesus enacts covenant personally</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Theological Effect</h5>
            <p>
              This technique collapses distinctions between person and promise. The NT doesn't say, 
              "Jesus fulfills Davidic prophecies"; it says, "Jesus <em>is</em> what David pointed to." 
              He embodies:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The seed promised in 2 Sam 7:12</li>
              <li>The temple David wanted to build (John 2:21)</li>
              <li>The covenant David received (Luke 22:20)</li>
              <li>The throne that endures forever (Luke 1:33)</li>
              <li>The Son adopted in Ps 2:7 (Rom 1:4)</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Case Study: John 2:19-22</h5>
            <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
              <em>"Jesus answered them, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.' 
              The Jews then said, 'It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you 
              raise it up in three days?' But he was speaking about the temple of his body. When 
              therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this."</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="small">
              The promise that David's son would "build a house for my name" finds fulfillment not 
              in stone but in flesh. Jesus' resurrected body becomes the new meeting place of God 
              and humanity—the ultimate Davidic temple.

            <h5>Technique Explained</h5>
            <p>
              Perhaps the most startling NT transformation is the redefinition of <em>how</em> the 
              Davidic king conquers. Second Temple expectation envisioned military victory (Pss Sol 17; 
              1 Enoch 48). Jesus conquers through crucifixion. The throne is a cross; the crown is thorns; 
              victory comes via self-giving sacrifice.

            <h5>Theological Effect</h5>
            <p>
              This inversion doesn't abandon power—it redefines it. Jesus defeats sin, death, and 
              Satan not by overpowering them externally but by absorbing their violence and rising 
              triumphant. The resurrection vindicates the way of the cross as the true path to victory.

              on him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow."</em>

            <p class="small">
              The Davidic king's path to enthronement runs through self-emptying and crucifixion. 
              Exaltation follows humiliation; coronation follows cross. This is David's pattern 
              (shepherd → wilderness → king) taken to cosmic depths.

            <h5>Literary Function</h5>
            <p>
              Matthew opens not with "In the beginning" (like John) but with genealogy—
              deliberate positioning of Jesus within Israel's covenantal history. The very first 
              verse identifies him with two covenant figures:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Son of Abraham:</strong> Heir of land and blessing promises (Gen 12:1-3)</li>
              <li><strong>Son of David:</strong> Heir of eternal throne promise (2 Sam 7:12-16)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The genealogy structures itself around David (1:2-6: Abraham to David; 1:7-11: 
              David to exile; 1:12-16: Exile to Christ), making David the pivot of Israel's story 
              and Jesus the climax.

              <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> God's promises to Abraham and David converge in one person</li>
              <li><strong>Royal Identity:</strong> "Christ" (Χριστός = Messiah = Anointed One) 
              links to Davidic anointing</li>
              <li><strong>Jewish Particularity:</strong> Jesus is specifically <em>Jewish</em> Messiah 
              before universal Savior</li>

            <h5>Parallel: Luke's Genealogy</h5>
            <p class="small">
              Luke 3:23-38 traces Jesus through David (3:31) all the way back to Adam (3:38), 
              emphasizing universal humanity. Where Matthew stresses Jewish kingship, Luke stresses 
              cosmic scope. Together: Jesus is Israel's king <em>and</em> humanity's representative.

              Gabriel's announcement is dense with Davidic covenant language. Every phrase 
              hyperlinks to promises made centuries earlier. The angel declares:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Davidic covenant is about to be fulfilled (not abandoned)</li>
              <li>The virgin birth doesn't replace Davidic lineage—it intensifies it</li>
              <li>Jesus will be both "Son of Most High" (divine) and "son of David" (human)</li>
              <li>The "forever" language of 2 Sam 7 will actualize in Jesus' eternal reign</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Mary's Response</h5>
            <p class="small">
              Mary's Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55) echoes Hannah's song (1 Sam 2:1-10)—the prayer 
              that introduced David's era. Both women celebrate God's reversal of expectations. 
              Hannah rejoiced at Samuel's birth (who anointed David); Mary rejoices at Jesus' 
              conception (ultimate David). The literary parallel is intentional: what began with 
              Hannah culminates with Mary.

        <h4>⚖️ Romans 1:3-4 — Gospel Summary</h4>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          <strong>Romans 1:3-4</strong> —
          <em>"Concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared 
          to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from 
          the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord."</em>

        <div class="grid-2">
          <div>
            <h5>Two-Stage Christology</h5>
            <p>
              Paul presents Jesus' identity in two dimensions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>According to the flesh:</strong> Descended from David—human, Jewish, royal lineage</li>
              <li><strong>According to the Spirit:</strong> Declared/appointed Son of God—divine, 
              resurrected, cosmic authority</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This isn't adoptionism (Jesus becoming divine at resurrection) but revelation— 
              resurrection <em>declares publicly</em> what was always true. The Davidic heir is 
              vindicated as divine Son.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Resurrection as Enthronement</h5>
            <p>
              Paul equates resurrection with Psalm 2:7 coronation language ("You are my Son; 
              today I have begotten you" = resurrection day, per Acts 13:33). For Paul:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Jesus' death = Davidic suffering (Ps 22; Isa 53)</li>
              <li>Jesus' resurrection = Davidic enthronement (Ps 2; 110)</li>
              <li>"Declared to be Son of God" = coronation as cosmic king</li>
              <li>"In power" = Spirit-empowered reign has begun</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
              This compressed statement contains Paul's entire gospel: Jesus is both true Israel 
              (Davidic seed) and true God (divine Son). Resurrection proves both claims simultaneously.

          <em>"This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. Being therefore exalted

          into the heavens, but he himself says, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, 
          until I make your enemies your footstool."' Let all the house of Israel therefore know for

            <h5>Exegetical Argument</h5>
            <p>
              Peter's logic unfolds in five steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Premise 1:</strong> Psalm 16:10 says "You will not abandon my soul to 
              Hades, nor let your Holy One see corruption"</li>
              <li><strong>Premise 2:</strong> David died and was buried—his tomb is here (v. 29)</li>
              <li><strong>Premise 3:</strong> Therefore David spoke <em>prophetically</em> about 
              someone else (v. 30-31)</li>
              <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> God raised Jesus from the dead—we are witnesses (v. 32)</li>
              <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Jesus is the one Psalm 16 and 110 spoke about; God 
              has made him "both Lord and Christ" (v. 36)</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Theological Claims</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>"Made him Lord and Christ":</strong> Resurrection = coronation; Jesus 
              now occupies Davidic throne</li>
              <li><strong>"Exalted at the right hand":</strong> Psalm 110:1 fulfilled—Jesus seated 
              in divine authority</li>
              <li><strong>"Poured out...the Holy Spirit":</strong> Enthroned king dispenses covenant 
              blessings</li>
              <li><strong>"This Jesus whom you crucified":</strong> The rejected one is the exalted 
              one (Ps 118:22)</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Result</h5>
            <p class="small">
              Three thousand respond with, "What shall we do?" (v. 37) and are baptized. The 
              proclamation that Jesus is Davidic Messiah becomes the church's founding message. 
              Christian identity begins with recognizing Jesus as the enthroned Son of David.

        <h4>🕊️ Hebrews 1:5, 13 — Superior to Angels</h4>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          <strong>Hebrews 1:5, 13</strong> —
          <em>"For to which of the angels did God ever say, 'You are my Son, today I have begotten you'? 
          Or again, 'I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son'?... And to which of the 
          angels has he ever said, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for 
          your feet'?"</em>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="grid-2">
          <div>
            <h5>Argument Structure</h5>
            <p>
              Hebrews opens with a cascade of OT quotations proving Jesus' superiority to angels. 
              The author strings together:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Psalm 2:7:</strong> Divine sonship ("You are my Son")</li>
              <li><strong>2 Samuel 7:14:</strong> Father-son relationship ("I will be to him a father")</li>
              <li><strong>Psalm 110:1:</strong> Enthronement at God's right hand</li>
              <li><strong>Psalm 45:6-7:</strong> "Your throne, O God, is forever" (addressing Messiah 
              as divine)</li>
              <li><strong>Psalm 102:25-27:</strong> Creator language applied to the Son</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Davidic Implications</h5>
            <p>
              By quoting 2 Sam 7:14 and Ps 2:7 in parallel (Heb 1:5), the author identifies Jesus 
              as the promised Davidic heir. But then he takes a stunning step: he applies divine 
              attributes and worship language (Ps 45:6) to this Davidic king. The logic:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Jesus is David's promised son (2 Sam 7)</li>
              <li>Yet he is worshiped as God (Ps 45:6)</li>
              <li>Therefore, the Davidic heir is divine—"God and man in one person"</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
              This sets up Hebrews' entire argument: Jesus qualifies as eternal high priest because 
              he's both truly human (Davidic descent) and truly divine (Psalm 110 priest-king). 
              Only such a figure can mediate the new covenant (Heb 8-10).

          <em>"And one of the elders said to me, 'Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah,

            <h5>Lion / Lamb Paradox (Rev 5)</h5>
            <p>
              John hears announcement of "Lion of Judah" (Gen 49:9-10 + Davidic imagery) but 
              <em>sees</em> "a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain" (Rev 5:6). This visual 
              irony encapsulates NT Christology:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The conquering Lion <em>is</em> the slaughtered Lamb</li>
              <li>Victory comes through sacrificial death, not military might</li>
              <li>The Davidic king defeats enemies by absorbing their violence</li>
              <li>Worthiness to open scroll = worthiness to judge = sacrificial atonement</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Root and Offspring (Rev 22:16)</h5>
            <p>
              Jesus calls himself both "root" (ῥίζα) and "descendant" (γένος) of David—an 
              impossible paradox unless:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>As eternal Word:</strong> Jesus is David's <em>root</em> (pre-exists David; 
              John 1:1-2)</li>
              <li><strong>As incarnate Son:</strong> Jesus is David's <em>offspring</em> (born from 
              Mary's Davidic line)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="small" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
              This echoes Isaiah 11:10 ("root of Jesse") and Isaiah 11:1 ("shoot from the stump of Jesse"). 
              Jesus is simultaneously David's source and David's heir—origin and fulfillment, alpha 
              and omega of the covenant story.
            </p>

            <h5>"Bright Morning Star"</h5>
            <p class="small">
              Links to Numbers 24:17 ("a star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out 
              of Israel"). The Davidic king is the light that ends darkness, inaugurating eternal day 
              in New Jerusalem (Rev 21:23-25; 22:5).

      <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        <strong>Interpretive Principle:</strong> The NT doesn't abandon Second Temple categories but 
        transforms them christologically. Where Judaism expected a coming Davidic king, Christianity 
        proclaims that king has come, died, risen, and reigns—now and forever. The transformation 
        honors the original promise while radically reinterpreting its fulfillment through the lens 
        of cross and resurrection.

    <!-- SECTION 6: THEOLOGICAL OUTCOMES -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="theological-outcomes">
      <h3>Theological Outcomes & Implications</h3>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🌍 From Nation to Creation</h4>
          <p>
            The NT expands Davidic hope from Israel's restoration to cosmic reconciliation. 
            Paul declares the gospel reveals God's plan "to unite all things in [Christ], things 
            in heaven and things on earth" (Eph 1:10). Jesus doesn't just restore Israel—he 
            restores <em>creation</em>. The Davidic king becomes the "last Adam" (1 Cor 15:45) 
            through whom humanity's original vocation (Gen 1:26-28) is fulfilled.
          </p>

          <h4>⏰ From Future to Present</h4>
          <p>
            "The kingdom of God is at hand" (Mark 1:15) declares that eschatological realities 
            have broken into history. Jesus' healings, exorcisms, and teaching demonstrate the 
            "age to come" invading "this present age." Yet the kingdom remains "not yet" fully 
            consummated—requiring second coming for completion. This "already/not yet" tension 
            defines Christian eschatology.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>💪 From Force to Love</h4>
          <p>
            The most subversive NT claim: power operates through self-giving sacrifice. "God shows 
            his strength in weakness" (2 Cor 12:9). The Davidic king doesn't conquer by crushing 
            enemies but by dying for them. Romans 5:10 captures this: "While we were enemies we 
            were reconciled to God by the death of his Son." Enemies become family through the 
            cross—the ultimate power-reversal.
          </p>

          <h4>🏛️ From Temple to Body</h4>
          <p>
            Jesus' claim that his body is the temple (John 2:21) radically relocates divine presence. 
            God no longer dwells in stone structures but in resurrected flesh—and by extension, in 
            the church (1 Cor 3:16; Eph 2:21-22). The promise that David's son would "build a house 
            for my name" finds fulfillment in a living, growing, multinational temple of believers 
            indwelt by Spirit.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="significance" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        <h4>Pastoral & Missiological Implications</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Continuity with Israel:</strong> Christians aren't "new Israel" replacing 
          old but Gentiles grafted into Israel's story (Rom 11:17-24)</li>
          <li><strong>Suffering Precedes Glory:</strong> If the Davidic king reached throne via 
          cross, his followers expect same pattern (Rom 8:17)</li>
          <li><strong>Kingdom Ethics:</strong> Power operates through service; greatness through 
          humility (Mark 10:42-45)</li>
          <li><strong>Missionary Urgency:</strong> If Jesus reigns now, gospel must reach "all 
          nations" before consummation (Matt 24:14; 28:18-20)</li>
          <li><strong>Hope Anchored in History:</strong> Faith isn't wishful thinking but 
          confidence in what God did in Jesus—dateable, historical, witnessed</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 7: SYNTHESIS -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="synthesis">
      <h3>Synthesis: The Davidic Thread Woven Through Scripture</h3>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Canonical Arc:</strong> David's story generates a narrative momentum that propels 
        the entire biblical storyline from 2 Samuel through Revelation. The covenant promise of 
        an eternal throne becomes the organizing principle of Israel's hope, Judaism's expectation, 
        and Christianity's proclamation. Every thread—political, cultic, ethical, cosmic—converges

          <h4>📖 How Second Temple Sustained Hope</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Preserved Davidic memory through Psalms in worship</li>
            <li>Reinterpreted covenant promise as eschatological expectation</li>
            <li>Developed "Son of David" as technical messianic title</li>
            <li>Maintained genealogical records proving Davidic lineage</li>
            <li>Created literary traditions (Pss Sol, 4QFlor) expressing longing</li>
            <li>Used Targums to make royal psalms explicitly messianic</li>
            <li>Sustained belief that God's oath to David would not fail</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
            Without Second Temple Judaism's preservation of Davidic hope, Christianity's messianic 
            claims would have lacked biblical and cultural foundation. Jesus appeared precisely when 
            "Son of David" expectations were at fever pitch (c. 4 BCE – 30 CE).

          <h4>✝️ How New Testament Fulfilled & Transformed</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Identified Jesus as the awaited Son of David (genealogies)</li>
            <li>Proclaimed resurrection as royal enthronement (Acts 2; Rom 1:4)</li>
            <li>Reinterpreted "conquering enemies" as defeating sin/death</li>
            <li>Universalized kingdom to include Gentiles (Eph 2:11-22)</li>
            <li>Unified priestly and royal offices in one person (Heb 7)</li>
            <li>Made temple Jesus' body and church (John 2:21; 1 Cor 3:16)</li>
            <li>Declared kingdom "already" inaugurated, "not yet" consummated</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
            The NT doesn't replace Davidic hope but claims its fulfillment. Jesus doesn't stop being 
            Jewish or Davidic; rather, his Jewish particularity becomes the means of universal salvation. 
            As Paul writes: "Christ became a servant to the circumcised...in order that the Gentiles 
            might glorify God for his mercy" (Rom 15:8-9).

<div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
    <strong>Final Verdict:</strong> The Davidic covenant is the load-bearing beam of biblical 
    theology. Without it, Jesus' identity as Messiah lacks foundation. With it, his life, death, 
    and resurrection become the climax of a story God has been telling since 2 Samuel 7. Second 
    Temple Judaism kept that story alive through five centuries without a king. The New Testament 
    announces the King has come, the throne is occupied, and the eternal reign has begun. This is 
    the gospel: Jesus is Lord—David's Lord, Israel's Lord, creation's Lord—because God raised him 
    from the dead and seated him at the right hand of majesty.
