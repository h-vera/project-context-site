    <!-- NARRATIVE ARC OVERVIEW -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative-arc">
      <h3>Narrative Arc Overview</h3>

      <p>
        David's story spans approximately 70 years and transforms Israel's political and spiritual landscape.
        The narrative moves through distinct phases—<strong>hidden election → public vindication → wilderness testing → 
        royal consolidation → covenant promise → moral collapse → costly consequences → redirected hope</strong>.
        Each phase reveals character, tests faith, and advances God's redemptive purposes.
      </p>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Narrative Pattern:</strong>
        Hidden election → public vindication → priestly-royal consolidation → covenant promise → 
        moral collapse with enduring consequences → redirected hope to a future, faithful Son of David.

    <!-- SECTION 1: ANOINTING IN OBSCURITY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="anointing-obscurity">
      <h3>Phase 1: Anointed in Obscurity (1 Samuel 16)</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>1 Samuel 16:12–13</strong> —
        <em>"He sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome.
        And the LORD said, 'Arise, anoint him, for this is he.' Then Samuel took the horn of oil
        and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David
        from that day forward."</em>
      </blockquote>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🎯 The Scene</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Setting:</strong> Jesse's house in Bethlehem; David absent, tending sheep</li>
            <li><strong>Process:</strong> Seven brothers pass before Samuel; all rejected</li>
            <li><strong>Reversal:</strong> The overlooked youngest is summoned and immediately anointed</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Spirit empowerment; Saul simultaneously loses the Spirit (16:14)</li>
            <li><strong>Secrecy:</strong> No public coronation—David must wait in hidden faith</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Theological Significance</h5>
          <p>
            The private anointing establishes David's legitimacy <em>before</em> his public achievements.
            His identity is secured by divine choice, not human acclaim. This pattern—God's hidden work
            preceding public vindication—shapes the entire narrative and anticipates Jesus' own hiddenness
            in Nazareth before his public ministry.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🔥 Spirit Empowerment</h4>
          <p>
            The Hebrew phrase <span class="hebrew">וַתִּצְלַח עָלָיו רוּחַ־יְהוָה</span> 
            (<em>wattiṣlaḥ ʿālāyw rûaḥ-YHWH</em>) means "the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him"—
            violent, overwhelming, transformative. This is not gentle inspiration but divine invasion.
          </p>

          <h5>Spirit Dynamics in David's Story</h5>
          <table class="comparison-table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Character</th>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h5>Obscurity → Vindication Pattern</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Joseph:</strong> Pit → palace (hidden faithfulness → public honor)</li>
            <li><strong>Moses:</strong> Wilderness → deliverer (formation → commission)</li>
            <li><strong>David:</strong> Sheep → throne (anointed → enthroned)</li>
            <li><strong>Jesus:</strong> Nazareth → Messiah (hidden years → public ministry)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> David's obscure anointing teaches that identity precedes activity.
        He is king by divine decree before any public act validates it. The Spirit's empowerment
        sustains him through years of waiting, hunting, and testing. This hidden formation becomes
        the crucible where character is forged—preparing David not just to rule but to shepherd
        God's people with integrity.

    <!-- SECTION 2: THE SHEPHERD VS. THE GIANT -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="goliath-victory">
      <h3>Phase 2: The Shepherd vs. the Giant (1 Samuel 17)</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>1 Samuel 17:45–47</strong> —
        <em>"Then David said to the Philistine, 'You come to me with a sword and with a spear
        and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the
        armies of Israel, whom you have defied...that all this assembly may know that the LORD
        saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hand.'"</em>
      </blockquote>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>⚔️ The Confrontation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> Israelites paralyzed by Goliath's taunts for 40 days</li>
            <li><strong>David's Arrival:</strong> Bringing food to brothers; hears the defiance</li>
            <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Not reward but zeal—"Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?" (17:26)</li>
            <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> Lion and bear victories in wilderness (17:34-37)</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> Rejects Saul's armor; uses shepherd's tools (staff, stones, sling)</li>
            <li><strong>Victory:</strong> Single stone to forehead; beheading with Goliath's own sword</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Goliath as Chaos Monster</h5>
          <p>
            The narrative depicts Goliath using <strong>serpent/dragon imagery</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bronze armor:</strong> Hebrew <span class="hebrew">נְחֹשֶׁת</span> (<em>neḥōšet</em>) 
            echoes <span class="hebrew">נָחָשׁ</span> (<em>nāḥāš</em>, serpent)</li>
            <li><strong>Scale armor:</strong> <span class="hebrew">שִׁרְיוֹן קַשְׂקַשִּׂים</span> 
            (coat of scales)—sea-creature imagery</li>
            <li><strong>Head-crushing:</strong> Echoes Genesis 3:15 (seed striking serpent's head)</li>
            <li><strong>Defiance:</strong> Blasphemy against Israel's God = chaos vs. order</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🎯 Theological Themes</h4>
          
          <h5>Covenant Faith Over Conventional Power</h5>
          <p>
            David embodies Hannah's hope (1 Sam 2) that the LORD topples the mighty and lifts the lowly.
            Victory comes not through superior weaponry but through trust in Yahweh's covenant promises.
            The shepherd's tools—staff, sling, stones—become instruments of divine power.
          </p>

        <strong>Summary:</strong> The Goliath victory publicly reveals what the anointing privately declared:
        David is God's chosen warrior-king. His covenant trust becomes the template for righteous rule—
        power exercised through dependence on Yahweh, not human resources. This victory foreshadows the
        ultimate giant-slayer: Jesus, who defeats sin, death, and Satan not with sword but with sacrifice.

      <h3>Interlude: David & Jonathan—Covenant of Loyal Love</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>1 Samuel 18:1, 3–4</strong> —
        <em>"As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David,

          <h5>Jonathan's Self-Emptying</h5>

            Jonathan is Saul's heir—rightful next king by human standards. Yet he recognizes God's choice of David
            and willingly yields. This is <strong>covenant love (חֶסֶד)</strong> in action: loyal, self-sacrificing,
            rooted in divine purposes rather than personal advantage.

          <h5>Foreshadowing Christ's Love</h5>
          <p>
            Jonathan's self-emptying friendship mirrors the greater love of Christ:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Philippians 2:5–8:</strong> Christ "emptied himself...taking the form of a servant"</li>
            <li><strong>John 15:13:</strong> "Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends"</li>
            <li><strong>Romans 5:8:</strong> "God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us"</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>David's Grief (2 Samuel 1:17–27)</h5>
          <p>
            After Jonathan's death at Gilboa, David composes a lament honoring both Saul and Jonathan.
            His mourning is genuine—covenant love endures beyond death. This lament becomes a model for
            processing loss within God's sovereign plan.

        <strong>Summary:</strong> Jonathan's covenantal friendship reverses Saul's envy and models
        the loyal love (חֶסֶד) that characterizes God's own faithfulness. This friendship sustains David
        through wilderness years and teaches him that leadership must be rooted in self-giving service.
        Ultimately, Jonathan's love foreshadows the greater Friend who lays down his life—Jesus,
        the true Son of David who calls his followers friends (John 15:15).

    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="wilderness-formation">
      <h3>Phase 3: Refuge & Formation in the Wilderness (1 Samuel 19–31)</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>1 Samuel 24:12, 15</strong> —
        <em>"May the LORD judge between me and you, may the LORD avenge me against you,
        but my hand shall not be against you...May the LORD therefore be judge and give sentence
        between me and you, and see to it and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand."</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Hunted by Saul, David refuses to seize the throne by violence, entrusting vindication to God.
        The wilderness becomes a moral crucible—mercy toward enemies, dependence on God, and the forging
        of a community around the anointed but not-yet enthroned king. This phase shapes David's character
        and prepares him to rule with both strength and restraint.

          <h4>🏜️ Wilderness Geography & Theology</h4>
          
          <h5>Key Locations</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Adullam (cave):</strong> "Closed-in place" where outcasts gather (22:1–2)</li>
            <li><strong>Ziph wilderness:</strong> Hills east of Dead Sea; David's hideouts (23:14–15)</li>
            <li><strong>En-gedi:</strong> "Spring of the goat"; oasis amid barrenness (24:1)</li>
            <li><strong>Maon & Carmel:</strong> Nabal incident; testing of mercy (25:1–42)</li>
            <li><strong>Philistine territory:</strong> David's morally ambiguous refuge (27:1–12)</li>

          <h5>David's Wilderness Community</h5>
          <blockquote class="scripture-quote">

            <em>"And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was

            about four hundred men."</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            David attracts the <strong>marginalized and desperate</strong>—a "Robin Hood" band of outcasts.
            This ragtag crew becomes the nucleus of his mighty men (2 Sam 23:8–39). Leadership forged
            in shared suffering creates deeper loyalty than inherited authority.

          <h5>Test 1: Sparing Saul in the Cave (1 Samuel 24)</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Saul enters cave to relieve himself; David's men urge killing</li>
            <li><strong>David's choice:</strong> Cuts robe corner; immediately regrets even that</li>
            <li><strong>Speech:</strong> Confronts Saul outside, proves he could have killed him</li>
            <li><strong>Principle:</strong> "The LORD's anointed" is untouchable—God removes kings, not David</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Saul temporarily relents; admits David's righteousness</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Test 2: Sparing Saul in the Camp (1 Samuel 26)</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> David infiltrates Saul's sleeping camp; Abishai wants to strike</li>
            <li><strong>David's choice:</strong> Takes spear and water jar—proof of access without violence</li>
            <li><strong>Speech:</strong> Shouts from hilltop; shames Saul's bodyguards</li>
            <li><strong>Principle:</strong> Trust God's timing; don't force deliverance</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Saul admits sin; David departs to Philistine territory</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Test 3: Nabal & Abigail (1 Samuel 25)</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> David's men protected Nabal's shepherds; request food; Nabal insults them</li>
            <li><strong>David's response:</strong> Rage—prepares to kill all males in Nabal's household</li>
            <li><strong>Abigail's intervention:</strong> Wise woman brings feast; reminds David of his calling</li>
            <li><strong>David's repentance:</strong> Blesses Abigail for restraining him from bloodshed</li>
            <li><strong>God's justice:</strong> Nabal dies 10 days later (divine judgment, not David's vengeance)</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Key Insight: Two Successes, One Near-Failure</h5>
          <p>
            David passes the Saul tests (enemy of status) but nearly fails the Nabal test (personal honor).
            Even the anointed need <strong>moral accountability</strong> (Abigail) to restrain destructive impulses.

        <strong>Summary:</strong> The wilderness is David's seminary—where trust is tested, character refined,
        and leadership proven. His restraint toward Saul demonstrates the heart God saw in Bethlehem (1 Sam 16:7).
        Yet the Nabal incident reveals ongoing vulnerability—even the faithful need wise counselors (Abigail)
        to prevent self-destruction. This phase prepares David not just to take the throne but to <em>shepherd</em>
        Israel with mercy and justice.

    <!-- SECTION 5: JERUSALEM & ARK CONSOLIDATION -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="jerusalem-ark">
      <h3>Phase 4: Jerusalem & the Ark—Consolidation of Kingship (2 Samuel 5–6)</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>2 Samuel 5:2, 7</strong> —
        <em>"And the LORD said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince
        over Israel.'...And David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David."</em>

        brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the horn."</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        David unifies the tribes, captures Jerusalem (Zion), and brings the ark into the city,
        aligning political and cultic centers. This move frames David as a <strong>priestly king</strong>
        who blesses the people in God's name and situates Zion as a new Edenic meeting place of God and humanity.
      </p>

      <div class="grid-2">

          <h4>🏛️ Political Consolidation</h4>
          
          <h5>Anointed King Over All Israel (2 Sam 5:1–5)</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> After Saul's death, David rules Judah from Hebron (7 years)</li>
            <li><strong>Northern tribes:</strong> Recognize David after Ish-bosheth's assassination</li>
            <li><strong>Covenant language:</strong> "We are your bone and flesh" (kinship appeal)</li>
            <li><strong>Shepherd title:</strong> "You shall be <em>shepherd</em> of my people Israel" (5:2)</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> United monarchy; David reigns 33 years from Jerusalem</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Conquest of Jerusalem/Zion (2 Sam 5:6–10)</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strategic choice:</strong> Jebusite city on tribal border—neutral ground</li>
            <li><strong>Fortified stronghold:</strong> Jebusites mock: "Even blind/lame can defend"</li>
            <li><strong>David's victory:</strong> Conquers via water shaft; renames "City of David"</li>
            <li><strong>Building program:</strong> Hiram of Tyre sends cedar, craftsmen (5:11)</li>
            <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Jerusalem becomes <em>political capital</em> and future <em>temple site</em></li>

            <li><strong>Justice & righteousness:</strong> "David reigned...and administered justice" (8:15)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🕊️ Cultic Centralization: The Ark</h4>

          <h5>Bringing the Ark to Zion (2 Sam 6)</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Attempt 1 (6:1–11):</strong> Uzzah dies touching ark; improper transport</li>
            <li><strong>Pause (6:11):</strong> Ark stays with Obed-edom 3 months; blessing evident</li>
            <li><strong>Attempt 2 (6:12–19):</strong> Proper Levitical transport; sacrifices every 6 steps</li>
            <li><strong>David's worship:</strong> Dancing "with all his might" in linen ephod (priestly garment)</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Ark installed in tent; David blesses people; distributes food</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>David as Priestly King</h5>
          <p>
            David's actions blur king/priest boundaries:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wears ephod:</strong> Priestly garment (6:14)—visual priestly identification</li>
            <li><strong>Offers sacrifices:</strong> Burns offerings (6:13, 17)—priestly function</li>
            <li><strong>Blesses people:</strong> "In the name of the LORD of hosts" (6:18)—priestly benediction</li>
            <li><strong>Distributes food:</strong> Bread, meat, raisin cakes (6:19)—Edenic abundance/provision</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Michal's Contempt (2 Sam 6:16, 20–23)</h5>
          <p>
            Saul's daughter Michal despises David's exuberant worship. Her critique—"How the king of Israel
            honored himself today!"—reflects Saul's priority of <em>honor</em> over <em>worship</em>.
            David's response: "I will celebrate before the LORD...I will be even more undignified than this" (6:21–22).
            The narrator notes Michal "had no child to the day of her death"—Saul's line ends barren.

        <strong>Summary:</strong> The Jerusalem/Ark phase unites political power and worship, establishing
        Zion as the sacred center of Israel's life. David's priestly actions anticipate Psalm 110's vision
        of a king who is "priest forever." This consolidation sets the stage for 2 Samuel 7's covenant—
        God promises to build David a "house" (dynasty) because David has unified God's people and centered
        worship on Zion. The shepherd-king now sits enthroned, ready to receive God's eternal promise.

      <h3>Phase 5: The Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7)—Preview</h3>

      <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
        <strong>2 Samuel 7:12–16</strong> —
        <em>"When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring

        for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to him a father,
        and he shall be to me a son...And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.
        Your throne shall be established forever."</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        God promises David a "house" (dynasty), a royal son who will build God's true temple and whose
        throne God will establish forever. This covenant becomes a <strong>load-bearing beam</strong> in
        biblical theology, carrying messianic hope beyond David's lifetime and pointing toward the ultimate
        priest-king who fulfills the promise perfectly.

        <strong>Narrative Significance:</strong> Though forgiven (2 Sam 12:13), David faces enduring consequences—
        revealing that grace does not erase accountability. This rupture in David's reign intensifies the need for
        a <em>sinless</em> Son of David who will fulfill the covenant without moral collapse. The promise survives
        the failure, pointing hope beyond David to a greater King.

          <h4>🔑 Key Takeaways</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Hidden → Public:</strong> Private anointing (1 Sam 16) precedes public vindication (Goliath, Jerusalem).</li>
            <li><strong>Covenant Friendship:</strong> Jonathan's self-giving love models חֶסֶד (loyal love) and foreshadows Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>Wilderness Formation:</strong> Tests reveal character; David learns restraint, trust, and need for accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>Priestly King:</strong> Ark procession (2 Sam 6) unites worship and rule, anticipating Psalm 110.</li>
            <li><strong>Eternal Covenant:</strong> 2 Samuel 7 becomes Scripture's load-bearing messianic promise.</li>
            <li><strong>Failure & Grace:</strong> Collapse (2 Sam 11–19) intensifies hope for a sinless Son of David.</li>

          <h4>💬 Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>How does David's obscure anointing prepare him for the Goliath moment and beyond?</li>
            <li>What makes Jonathan's covenant love (חֶסֶד) different from Saul's self-serving approach?</li>
            <li>Why does David spare Saul twice but nearly kill Nabal? What does this reveal about his character?</li>
            <li>How does David's priestly-royal action (2 Sam 6) challenge or inform contemporary worship?</li>
            <li>What is the theological significance of the "house" (בַּיִת) wordplay in 2 Samuel 7?</li>
            <li>How does the covenant promise (2 Sam 7) survive David's moral failure (2 Sam 11–12)?</li>
