      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> David rises from an overlooked youngest son and shepherd to Israel's anointed king, embodying the biblical reversal where God exalts the humble and opposes the proud. His narrative arc—early faith and mercy, royal consolidation in Jerusalem, covenant promise of an everlasting dynasty, moral collapse, repentance, and a closing hope for a greater king—structures 1–2 Samuel and points beyond itself. Chronicles later retells David's story to highlight temple preparation and ideal kingship, sustaining post-exilic hope for the coming Messiah and a renewed temple presence.</p>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> In 2 Samuel 7, God pledges a "house" (dynasty) to David, anchoring Israel's messianic expectation: a royal son who will build God's true temple and establish an eternal kingdom. This promise reframes David's successes and failures within a redemptive trajectory that anticipates the ultimate priest-king who fulfills Psalm 110 and the Davidic covenant perfectly.

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Divine Election:</strong> The name "beloved" emphasizes God's choosing and affection—David is loved before he achieves anything.</li>
            <li><strong>Covenant Language:</strong> "Beloved" (דָּוִד) resonates with covenant love (חֶסֶד, <em>ḥesed</em>)—loyal, steadfast, committed affection.</li>
            <li><strong>Prophetic Echo:</strong> Solomon is named "Yedidiah" (beloved of YHWH) in 2 Sam 12:25, linking father and son in divine favor despite David's sin.</li>
            <li><strong>Messianic Connection:</strong> Jesus is repeatedly called "Son of David" (υἱὸς Δαυίδ) in the NT, inheriting both the name's affection and the covenant promise.</li>
            <li><strong>Irony & Reversal:</strong> A "beloved" shepherd becomes the beloved king; the least becomes the greatest—embodying Hannah's song (1 Sam 2).</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> David's name is not incidental—it proclaims his identity as the one whom God loves, chosen not for human merit but divine affection. This "beloved" status becomes the lens through which his entire story unfolds: from overlooked shepherd to anointed king, from moral failure to covenant promise, from earthly reign to eternal messianic hope.

    <!-- SECTION 3: SAMUEL'S INFLUENCE & THE ANOINTING -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="anointing-samuel">
      <h3>Samuel's Influence & The Anointing of David (1 Samuel 16)</h3>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theme:</strong> God reverses human sight.
        The prophet Samuel learns that Yahweh does not choose as humans do—He "looks on the heart" rather than stature, seniority, or appearance.
      </div>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>👁 Samuel the Seer</h4>
          <p>
            Samuel, whose name means "heard by God," bridges the era of judges to the monarchy.
            His obedience to the divine voice contrasts with Saul's disobedience, preparing the reader to
            recognize David as the true listener.
            In Bethlehem, Samuel nearly repeats Israel's mistake by assuming Jesse's oldest son is the chosen one.
            Yahweh corrects him: <em>"Man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart."</em>
          </p>
          
          <h5>Samuel's Formative Role</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Prophetic Mentor:</strong> Samuel's presence sanctifies the anointing and teaches David that kingship is divine stewardship, not personal possession.</li>
            <li><strong>Counter-Cultural Vision:</strong> By choosing the youngest, Samuel demonstrates that God's kingdom operates on different values than human hierarchies.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiritual Formation:</strong> David learns from Samuel's example that leadership flows from hearing and obeying God's voice—a pattern evident in David's psalms.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>🕊 Anointed in Obscurity</h4>
          <p>
            David—youngest, overlooked, tending sheep—is summoned last.
            The oil poured over his head marks both <em>divine reversal</em> and <em>royal commissioning</em>.
            The Spirit of Yahweh rushes upon him, while departing from Saul (1 Sam 16:13–14),
            beginning the long narrative contrast between an anointed yet rejected king
            and an anointed but hidden shepherd.
          </p>

          <h5>Elements of the Anointing Scene</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Private Ceremony:</strong> No crowds, no fanfare—only Jesse's household witnesses God's choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Spirit Empowerment:</strong> "The Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward" (1 Sam 16:13).</li>
            <li><strong>Saul's Decline:</strong> Simultaneously, "the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul" (16:14), creating the dramatic tension of two anointed ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden King:</strong> David is anointed but not enthroned—he must wait, trust, and be formed in obscurity.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

        <em>"Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him.

        but the LORD looks on the heart."</em>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">✨ The Reversal Motif</h4>
      <p>
        The choice of "the least" continues the biblical pattern of divine preference for the unexpected:
        Abel over Cain, Jacob over Esau, Joseph over his brothers, Moses the fugitive over Pharaoh's court.
        This reversal anticipates the prophetic hope of a new David—
        a humble servant who will reign through righteousness, not status.
      </p>

      <div class="grid-2" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <div class="panel">
          <h5>🔄 Pattern of Divine Reversal</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hannah's Song (1 Sam 2):</strong> "He raises the poor from the dust...to make them sit with princes"—programmatic for David's story.</li>
            <li><strong>Least → Greatest:</strong> Youngest son → anointed king → messianic prototype.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden → Revealed:</strong> Obscure shepherd → victor over Goliath → ruler of Israel.</li>
            <li><strong>Rejected → Exalted:</strong> Hunted by Saul → enthroned on Zion → eternal dynasty.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="panel">
          <h5>🎓 Theological Implications</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Grace, Not Merit:</strong> David's selection demonstrates that God's choice is not based on human qualification.</li>
            <li><strong>Formation in Obscurity:</strong> Leadership is forged in hidden places (shepherding) before public platforms (kingship).</li>
            <li><strong>Spirit Over Status:</strong> The Spirit's presence, not social standing, validates divine calling.</li>
            <li><strong>Messianic Foreshadowing:</strong> Jesus, too, is from unexpected origins (Nazareth, carpenter's son) yet is the ultimate Beloved Son.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">🩸 Samuel's Formation of David</h4>
      <p>
        Through Samuel's mentorship and prophetic words, David learns that kingship is stewardship, not possession.
        His earliest psalms mirror this dependency:
        <em>"You, LORD, are my shepherd" (Ps 23:1).</em>
        Even in exile, the memory of that anointing sustains him;
        the shepherd's heart becomes the prototype for a priestly-king who leads by hearing.
      </p>

      <div class="significance" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <h5>Impact on David's Character</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Humble Trust:</strong> David's refusal to seize the throne by force (1 Sam 24, 26) reflects Samuel's teaching that God exalts in His time.</li>
          <li><strong>Prophetic Awareness:</strong> David repeatedly seeks God's word through prophets (Nathan, Gad)—a pattern learned from Samuel.</li>
          <li><strong>Worship as Vocation:</strong> David's psalmic spirituality echoes Samuel's model of prayer and presence before the Lord.</li>
          <li><strong>Covenant Consciousness:</strong> The anointing instills in David an awareness that he is part of God's larger story, preparing him for 2 Samuel 7's covenant promise.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> Samuel's vision-correction sets the theological lens for all that follows:
        God sees the heart, exalts the lowly, and anoints the least to lead.
        The Spirit's rush in Bethlehem becomes the spark that will one day ignite Zion's mountain of worship.
        David's formation under Samuel establishes the pattern: true kingship flows from humble dependence, prophetic obedience, and Spirit-empowered service.

    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="not-firstborn">
      <h3>"Not the Firstborn" Theme</h3>

      <p>
        David embodies a recurring biblical motif: <strong>God's choice of the younger over the elder</strong>.
        This pattern—seen in Abel, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Ephraim, and Moses—signals that divine election
        operates independently of human primogeniture systems. The reversal demonstrates grace, disrupts
        expectations, and prepares for the ultimate reversal in Christ.

          <h4>💡 Theological Significance</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Grace Over Law:</strong> God's choice is not bound by cultural inheritance laws (birthright = primogeniture).</li>
            <li><strong>Humility Over Pride:</strong> Younger sons often exhibit humility, dependence, and trust (Joseph's faithfulness, David's shepherding).</li>
            <li><strong>Divine Sovereignty:</strong> "It depends not on human will or exertion, but on God who has mercy" (Rom 9:16).</li>
            <li><strong>Reversal Motif:</strong> "The last shall be first" (Matt 20:16)—a pattern fulfilled in Christ, the ultimate "younger brother" who inherits all.</li>
            <li><strong>Messianic Foreshadowing:</strong> Jesus is "Son of David" but also the unexpected king from Nazareth, reversing worldly expectations.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5 style="margin-top: 1rem;">David's Specific Context</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>David is Jesse's <strong>eighth son</strong> (youngest), not even initially considered (1 Sam 16:10-11).</li>
            <li>He is <strong>out in the fields</strong> with sheep—symbolically distant from power centers.</li>
            <li>Seven brothers pass before Samuel; all are rejected—<strong>completeness</strong> (seven) is insufficient; God's choice transcends human categories.</li>
            <li>When David arrives, Samuel anoints him <strong>immediately</strong>—no deliberation, confirming divine clarity.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> The "not the firstborn" theme in David's election reinforces the Bible's core message:
        God's kingdom advances through grace, not entitlement; through humble dependence, not inherited privilege.
        David's journey from youngest son to messianic prototype establishes the pattern fulfilled in Jesus—
        the stone the builders rejected becomes the cornerstone (Ps 118:22; Matt 21:42).

    <!-- SECTION 5: SHEPHERD TO KING TRAJECTORY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="shepherd-king">
      <h3>Shepherd to King Trajectory</h3>

      <p>
        David's identity as <strong>shepherd</strong> is not merely occupational but <strong>vocational and theological</strong>.
        The shepherd metaphor shapes his leadership style, informs his psalms, and becomes a lens through which
        Israel understands kingship. This trajectory—from literal shepherd of sheep to metaphorical shepherd of
        God's people—anticipates Jesus, the Good Shepherd (John 10).
      </p>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🐑 Shepherd: Formation in the Wilderness</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Literal Calling:</strong> David tends Jesse's flock in Bethlehem's fields (1 Sam 16:11), learning care, vigilance, and sacrifice.</li>
            <li><strong>Wilderness Training:</strong> Confronting lion and bear (1 Sam 17:34-37) teaches courage, resourcefulness, and dependence on God.</li>
            <li><strong>Solitude & Worship:</strong> The fields become David's sanctuary—where he composes psalms and cultivates intimacy with Yahweh.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection Ethic:</strong> A good shepherd <em>lays down his life</em> for the sheep (cf. John 10:11)—a pattern David will both fulfill and fail.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Shepherd Psalms</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Psalm 23:</strong> "The LORD is my shepherd"—David's own shepherding experience informs his trust in God.</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 78:70-72:</strong> "He chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds...to shepherd Jacob his people."</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 80:1:</strong> "Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock!"</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>👑 King: Shepherd of Israel</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Shepherd-King Language:</strong> When the tribes anoint David, they say, "You shall be shepherd of my people Israel" (2 Sam 5:2)—not merely "ruler" but <em>shepherd</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Jerusalem/Zion:</strong> The shepherd brings the flock to the high mountain—Zion becomes the new pasture of God's presence.</li>
            <li><strong>Ark Procession (2 Sam 6):</strong> David leads the people in worship, uniting pastoral care with priestly function.</li>
            <li><strong>Covenant Protection (2 Sam 7):</strong> God promises to "shepherd" David's house, establishing an eternal dynasty.</li>
            <li><strong>Moral Failure (2 Sam 11):</strong> David the shepherd becomes David the predator—taking Bathsheba and killing Uriah, inverting his shepherd vocation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Prophetic Fulfillment</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ezekiel 34:23-24:</strong> "I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David...I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them."</li>
            <li><strong>John 10:11, 14:</strong> Jesus: "I am the good shepherd...I know my own and my own know me."</li>
            <li><strong>1 Peter 5:4:</strong> Christ is "the chief Shepherd" who appears to reward faithful under-shepherds.</li>

      <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> David's shepherd-to-king trajectory is not a career progression but a theological pattern.
        The shepherd learns care, protection, sacrifice, and worship in obscurity; the king applies these virtues to
        leading God's people. When David fails as shepherd (Bathsheba, Uriah), the covenant survives because God
        himself is the ultimate Shepherd. Jesus fulfills the pattern perfectly—the Good Shepherd who lays down his
        life, rises as King, and shepherds the flock eternally.

    <!-- SECTION 6: CHARACTER TYPE & COMPLEXITY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="character-complexity">
      <h3>Character Type & Complexity Indicators</h3>

      <p>
        David is the <strong>most developed character in the Old Testament</strong>, with more narrative space
        than any figure except Jesus in the Gospels. His complexity is deliberately crafted to reveal the
        tensions between divine election and human frailty, royal power and moral accountability, covenant promise
        and personal failure. The biblical authors present David not as a flawless hero but as a <em>realistic portrait</em>
        of humanity under God's grace.
      </p>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📊 Narrative Complexity Indicators</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Page Count:</strong> 1 Samuel 16 – 1 Kings 2 (approx. 65 chapters) plus 1–2 Chronicles retellings and 73+ Davidic Psalms.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Dimensionality:</strong> Warrior, musician, poet, king, priest, husband, father, friend, sinner, penitent.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Tension:</strong> Faith vs. fear, mercy vs. violence, trust vs. manipulation, worship vs. lust.</li>
            <li><strong>Moral Ambiguity:</strong> David spares Saul twice (1 Sam 24, 26) but murders Uriah (2 Sam 11); praises God while committing adultery.</li>
            <li><strong>Psychological Depth:</strong> Psalms reveal David's inner life—doubt, guilt, joy, longing—creating intimacy with the reader.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Literary Techniques Used</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Focalization:</strong> Shifts between external narration and David's internal perspective (especially in Psalms).</li>
            <li><strong>Irony:</strong> The shepherd who defeats giants becomes the king who preys on his own soldier's wife.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Recurring tests (Saul, Nabal, Bathsheba) reveal character patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Type Scenes:</strong> Confrontation with enemies, wilderness refuge, throne succession—archetypal moments that invite comparison.</li>

          </table>

          <h5>Moral Complexity</h5>
          <p>
            David's story refuses simplistic hero-worship. He is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Faithful yet flawed:</strong> Trusts God against Goliath but uses deception with Achish (1 Sam 21, 27).</li>
            <li><strong>Merciful yet violent:</strong> Spares Saul but slaughters Ammonites (2 Sam 12:31).</li>
            <li><strong>Worshipful yet lustful:</strong> Dances before the ark (2 Sam 6) then takes Bathsheba from the roof (2 Sam 11).</li>
            <li><strong>Beloved yet divisive:</strong> Unites Israel but causes family fracture (Amnon, Absalom, Adonijah).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="significance" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <h4>Why This Complexity Matters</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Realism:</strong> The Bible presents human nature honestly—even God's chosen struggle with sin.</li>
          <li><strong>Grace:</strong> David's failures magnify God's covenant faithfulness—the promise survives moral collapse.</li>
          <li><strong>Messianic Necessity:</strong> David's imperfection points to the need for a <em>sinless</em> Son of David.</li>
          <li><strong>Pastoral Relevance:</strong> Leaders who fail yet repent find hope in David's story; grace is not earned, it's received.</li>
          <li><strong>Christological Contrast:</strong> David's complexity highlights Jesus' perfection—the true King who fulfills without failure.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> David's character complexity is a theological tool, not a narrative flaw.
        The biblical authors craft a multidimensional portrait to demonstrate that God's covenant is not dependent
        on human perfection but on divine grace. David's successes and failures together create the longing for
        a greater King—one who will embody David's faith without his sin, his worship without his lust, his
        shepherd's heart without his predatory violence. That King is Jesus, the Son of David who reigns forever.
