<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<div class="theology-card" id="overview">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <div class="meta">
    <div class="kv"><strong>Scripture:</strong> 1 Samuel 28:3–25</div>
    <div class="kv"><strong>Hebrew:</strong> בַּעֲלַת אוֹב (ba'alat-'ôb) – "mistress of a spirit / necromancer"</div>
    <div class="kv"><strong>Etymology:</strong> בַּעַל (ba'al = "master/owner") + אוֹב ('ôb = "spirit/ghost")</div>
    <div class="kv"><strong>Role:</strong> Medium in Endor</div>
    <div class="kv"><strong>Setting:</strong> On the eve of Saul's final battle with the Philistines</div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Medium of Endor is sought out by Saul in disguise when God refuses to answer him. Though necromancy was outlawed in Israel (Deut 18:10–12), she reluctantly agrees to summon Samuel's spirit. Samuel delivers God's final judgment: Saul and his sons will die the next day. Ironically, she shows more compassion to Saul than his own household, preparing a last meal for the doomed king.</p>
  <div class="key-insight"><strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Her story highlights the futility of seeking power outside God's word. It underscores Saul's tragic decline: from chosen king to desperate seeker of forbidden voices. The woman becomes an ironic vessel of truth and compassion, contrasting with Saul's fear and disobedience.</div>
</div>

<!-- NARRATIVE -->
<div class="theology-card" id="narrative">
  <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
  <div class="timeline">
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Saul's Desperation (1 Sam 28:3–8):</strong> God is silent (no dreams, prophets, Urim). Saul disguises himself and seeks the medium at Endor.</div>
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Summoning Samuel (28:9–14):</strong> The woman fears the king's ban on mediums but is persuaded. To her shock, she sees Samuel rise and realizes her client is Saul.</div>
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Prophecy of Doom (28:15–19):</strong> Samuel rebukes Saul for disobedience and foretells his death and Israel's defeat.</div>
    <div class="timeline-item"><strong>Meal of Mercy (28:20–25):</strong> The woman comforts the shaken king, preparing him food before he departs to his final battle.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="key-insight"><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The structure of the encounter moves from disguise → revelation → judgment → ironic compassion. God's word of judgment is inescapable, even through forbidden means.</div>
</div>

<!-- LITERARY CONTEXT -->
<div class="theology-card" id="literary-context">
  <h3>Literary Context & Structure</h3>
  <div class="grid-4">
    <div class="panel"><h4>📚 Position in Book</h4><p>This episode stands as the climax of Saul's decline, immediately preceding his death in 1 Samuel 31. It contrasts Saul's rejection of God's word with David's reliance on God's guidance (chs. 29–30).</p></div>
    <div class="panel"><h4>🔄 Literary Patterns</h4><p>Repeated phrases ("God did not answer") frame Saul's desperation. Contrast: Saul seeks hidden voices; David seeks Yahweh's counsel.</p></div>
    <div class="panel"><h4>🎭 Character Function</h4><p>The medium functions as an ironic truth-bearer: an outsider who sees clearly while the king is blind.</p></div>
    <div class="panel"><h4>✍️ Narrative Techniques</h4><p>Dramatic irony: Saul disguises himself, but his true identity is revealed. Reversal: a forbidden necromancer offers compassion, while God's prophet offers only judgment.</p></div>
  </div>

<!-- THEMES -->
<div class="theology-card" id="themes">
  <h3>Major Theological Themes</h3>
  <div class="grid-3">
    <div><h4>⚖️ Judgment</h4><p>Saul's downfall is sealed by God's word, not altered by necromancy.</p></div>
    <div><h4>💡 Irony</h4><p>The outsider woman shows humanity, while Israel's king collapses in despair.</p></div>

  <h3>Ancient Near Eastern Context & Biblical Distinctives</h3>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div><h4>📜 ANE Parallels</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Necromancy was practiced in Mesopotamia and Ugarit (ritual texts invoke the dead for guidance).</li>
        <li>Kings sometimes employed mediums secretly despite prohibitions (Akkadian ša'ilu texts).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div><h4>⚡ Biblical Distinctives</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Israel uniquely condemns necromancy as rebellion against God (Deut 18:9–12; Lev 20:6).</li>
        <li>The narrative turns the medium into a moral foil, showing kindness where Israel's king fails.</li>
      </ul>
