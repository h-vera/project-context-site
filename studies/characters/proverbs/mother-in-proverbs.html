      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The mother in Proverbs appears as an authoritative wisdom teacher whose instruction (torah) carries equal weight with the father's. From the opening chapter's command to heed maternal teaching to King Lemuel's mother's oracle on just rulership, mothers embody the transmission of covenant wisdom across generations. Her voice frames the entire book, demonstrating that divine wisdom flows through ordinary family relationships.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The mother's teaching authority in Proverbs elevates human maternal wisdom to the status of divine revelation, showing that God's instruction comes through both parents equally. Her prominent role establishes the family as the primary locus of theological education and covenant faithfulness.</div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Foundational Authority (Prov 1:8):</strong>
          The mother appears in the book's opening instruction: "Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching (torah)." This establishes maternal teaching as torah‚Äîthe same word used for divine law‚Äîpositioning mothers as mediators of God's wisdom from the outset.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Binding Wisdom (Prov 6:20-23):</strong>
          The parallel command to "keep your father's command and do not forsake your mother's teaching" uses imagery of binding them on the heart and wearing them as ornaments. The mother's torah becomes a lamp and light, guiding through life's darkness‚Äîlanguage typically reserved for God's word.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Joy and Grief (Prov 10:1; 15:20; 23:22-25):</strong>
          Multiple proverbs highlight how children's choices bring joy or grief to mothers specifically. The wise child gladdens the mother's heart, while the foolish child brings her sorrow. This emotional dimension reveals the deep investment mothers have in their children's moral formation.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Royal Oracle (Prov 31:1-9):</strong>
          King Lemuel's mother delivers an oracle (massa)‚Äîa prophetic utterance‚Äîinstructing him in just kingship. She warns against dissipation, commands defense of the poor, and establishes justice as the foundation of rule. Her words carry prophetic authority, shaping royal policy and ethics.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The mother's presence moves from co-equal teacher to emotional stakeholder to prophetic voice, revealing the multifaceted nature of maternal wisdom that encompasses instruction, relationship, and divine authority.</div>
