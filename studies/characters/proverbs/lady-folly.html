      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Lady Folly is the dark counterpart to Lady Wisdom in Proverbs 1-9, personifying chaos, temptation, and moral failure. Appearing as both the "strange woman" who seduces the simple and as Folly herself hosting a deadly banquet, she represents all forces that pull humanity away from God's order. Her smooth words and stolen pleasures promise satisfaction but deliver death, making her the embodiment of humanity's destructive rejection of divine wisdom.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Lady Folly reveals that sin is not merely personal weakness but participation in cosmic disorder. Her presence in Proverbs establishes the high stakes of wisdom's call: the choice between wisdom and folly is ultimately a choice between life and death, order and chaos, covenant faithfulness and spiritual adultery.</div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>First Warning (Prov 2:16-19):</strong>
          The father warns his son that wisdom will save him from the "strange woman" with smooth words who has abandoned the partner of her youth and forgotten her covenant with God. Her house sinks down to death, and her paths lead to the shades. None who go to her return or regain the paths of life.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Seductress Exposed (Prov 5:1-23):</strong>
          An extended warning reveals her lips drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil, but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol. The father urges drinking from one's own cistern—faithfulness in marriage as protection against her allure.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Night Encounter (Prov 7:1-27):</strong>
          The most vivid portrayal: the father witnesses a young man lacking sense approaching her corner at twilight. She meets him dressed as a prostitute, loud and wayward, seizing and kissing him, using religious language to justify adultery. Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Folly's Fatal Feast (Prov 9:13-18):</strong>
          Lady Folly sits at her door, on a seat at the high places of the town, calling to passersby. She mimics Wisdom's invitation but offers stolen water and secret bread. Her guests do not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Lady Folly's appearances escalate from distant warning to dramatic encounter to final parody of wisdom's feast, progressively revealing how chaos disguises itself as desirable while leading inevitably to death.</div>

      <div class="significance">
        <h4>Literary Significance</h4>
        <p>The parallel structure reveals Folly as Wisdom's dark mirror. While both call from the high places to the simple, Wisdom offers legitimate feast leading to life while Folly offers stolen pleasures leading to death. This literary architecture forces readers to recognize that Folly deliberately parodies divine wisdom, making discernment crucial.</p>
