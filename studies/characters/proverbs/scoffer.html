      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Scoffer represents the final stage of folly's progression—beyond simple naivety or even foolishness to active, arrogant opposition to wisdom. He doesn't merely reject instruction; he mocks it, considering himself superior to all teachers. His presence poisons communities with strife and cynicism. The scoffer is the anti-learner, whose pride has made him utterly unteachable, representing the most dangerous form of folly because he actively corrupts others.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The Scoffer embodies the satanic principle of pride that opposes God's wisdom. His mockery represents not just intellectual arrogance but spiritual rebellion—the same pride that cast Satan from heaven and continues to corrupt human hearts. He shows how pride ultimately makes one an enemy of both God and community.</div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Delighting in Mockery (Prov 1:22):</strong>
          "Scoffers delight in their scoffing." Unlike the simple who are merely naive or fools who are stupid, scoffers actively enjoy mocking wisdom. They've made cynicism their identity and take pleasure in tearing down what others build up.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Dangerous to Correct (Prov 9:7-8):</strong>
          "Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury. Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you." The scoffer doesn't just reject correction—he attacks those who try to help him, making him dangerous to approach.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Unteachable Son (Prov 13:1):</strong>
          "A wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke." The scoffer's pride extends even to rejecting parental authority, breaking the fundamental bond of wisdom transmission between generations.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Unable to Find Wisdom (Prov 14:6):</strong>
          "A scoffer seeks wisdom in vain." Even when the scoffer tries to find wisdom, his pride blinds him to it. His mockery has created a spiritual blindness that prevents him from recognizing truth even when it's before him.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Hating the Wise (Prov 15:12):</strong>
          "A scoffer does not like to be reproved; he will not go to the wise." The scoffer actively avoids those who could help him, preferring the company of fellow mockers who reinforce his arrogance.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Source of Strife (Prov 22:10):</strong>
          "Drive out a scoffer, and strife will go out, and quarreling and abuse will cease." The scoffer is identified as the primary source of community discord. His removal brings immediate peace, showing how one mocker can poison an entire group.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Named and Defined (Prov 21:24):</strong>
          "'Scoffer' is the name of the arrogant, haughty man who acts with arrogant pride." This verse provides the clearest definition: the scoffer is pride personified, acting out of overwhelming arrogance.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The scoffer's journey shows the terminal nature of pride—from delighting in mockery to becoming unteachable, from seeking wisdom in vain to spreading discord, ultimately becoming so toxic that only removal can restore peace.</div>
