      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Adulteress or Strange Woman represents one of Proverbs' most urgent warnings, appearing repeatedly as a seductive figure who leads young men to destruction. She is both a literal warning against adultery and a metaphor for all forms of covenant unfaithfulness. Her smooth words and promised pleasures conceal a path to death. While related to Lady Folly, the Adulteress focuses specifically on sexual temptation and its spiritual implications, showing how infidelity to one's spouse mirrors infidelity to God.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The Adulteress reveals that sexual sin is never merely physical but always spiritual—a betrayal of covenant relationships both human and divine. Her portrayal demonstrates how sin disguises destruction as desirability and uses religious language to justify evil, making her a paradigm for all temptation.</div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Smooth Words and Forgotten Covenant (Prov 2:16-19):</strong>
          She speaks with smooth words but has "forsaken the companion of her youth and forgotten the covenant of her God." Her house sinks down to death, her paths to the departed. None who go to her return or regain the paths of life—establishing the irreversible nature of her destruction.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Honey Lips and Bitter End (Prov 5:3-14):</strong>
          "The lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil, but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword." The contrast between initial sweetness and final bitterness becomes a recurring theme. The passage warns of public disgrace and squandered wealth.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The High Cost of Adultery (Prov 6:24-35):</strong>
          A unique economic argument: while a prostitute costs only a loaf of bread, adultery costs one's very life. The jealous husband's fury will accept no compensation. "Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?"—showing adultery's inevitable consequences.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Dramatic Seduction Scene (Prov 7:6-27):</strong>
          The most detailed narrative: the father watches from his window as a young man "lacking sense" approaches her corner at twilight. She meets him dressed as a prostitute, kisses him brazenly, and uses religious language: "I had to offer sacrifices, today I have paid my vows." She promises pleasure on perfumed beds while her husband is away. The young man follows "as an ox goes to slaughter."
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Deep Pit and Narrow Well (Prov 22:14; 23:27-28):</strong>
          "The mouth of forbidden women is a deep pit; he with whom the LORD is angry will fall into it." She is like a narrow well—easy to fall into, impossible to escape. She "lies in wait like a robber and increases the traitors among mankind."
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The adulteress's portrayal intensifies from warning to vivid narrative, from metaphor to dramatic scene, consistently emphasizing the contrast between surface appeal and hidden destruction, between momentary pleasure and permanent ruin.</div>

        <strong>Contemporary Challenge:</strong> In a hypersexualized culture that treats adultery as entertainment and pornography as normal, the Adulteress's portrait remains urgently relevant. She warns that sexual sin still leads to spiritual death, broken families, and societal decay. Her use of religious language to justify sin particularly warns against spiritualizing sexual unfaithfulness.</div>
