      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Son is the silent addressee throughout Proverbs 1-9, representing every learner who must choose between competing voices of Wisdom and Folly. Though he never speaks, his presence frames the entire book as an invitation to discipleship. He embodies youth at the threshold of moral decision, vulnerability to deception, and the potential for transformation through wisdom. The Son is not merely a literary device but the reader's own position in the text.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The Son represents humanity's perpetual position as learners before divine wisdom, showing that discipleship is not a stage to graduate from but the permanent posture of the wise. His silent presence invites every reader to see themselves as the one being addressed by both human and divine instruction.</div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Initial Warning and Call (Prov 1:8-19):</strong>
          The son is immediately addressed with parental authority and warned against the enticement of sinners. He stands at the first crossroads: will he heed parental wisdom or follow the crowd toward violence and greed?
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Invitation to Seek Wisdom (Prov 2:1-22):</strong>
          The son is called to actively pursue wisdom like hidden treasure, with promises of understanding, protection, and deliverance. His role shifts from passive recipient to active seeker who must "cry out" for insight.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Covenant Formation (Prov 3:1-35):</strong>
          The son receives Torah-like commands to bind wisdom to his heart, with promises of life, peace, and divine favor. He is being initiated into covenant relationship through wisdom instruction.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Generational Reception (Prov 4:1-27):</strong>
          The son learns he is part of a wisdom lineage, as his father shares what he learned from his father. He discovers his place in a multi-generational chain of wisdom transmission.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Sexual Temptation Warnings (Prov 5-7):</strong>
          The son faces increasingly urgent warnings about the "strange woman," with chapter 7 presenting a dramatic scene of a young man's destruction. The son must choose between marital faithfulness and fatal attraction.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Wisdom's Universal Call (Prov 8):</strong>
          Lady Wisdom addresses not just "my son" but all humanity. The son discovers his particular instruction connects to universal, cosmic wisdom available to all who seek.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Final Choice: Two Banquets (Prov 9):</strong>
          The son faces the ultimate decision between Lady Wisdom's feast of life and Lady Folly's banquet of death. The entire instructional prologue culminates in this binary choice that will determine his destiny.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The son's journey moves from external warnings about obvious dangers to internal formation of character, from passive reception to active pursuit, from individual instruction to cosmic invitation, culminating in a final choice that every reader must make.</div>

The son stands at the center of this literary architecture as the one who must receive and transmit wisdom to the next generation.</p>
