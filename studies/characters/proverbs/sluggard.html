      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Sluggard is Proverbs' satirical portrait of laziness taken to its absurd extreme. Through vivid and often humorous vignettes, he embodies the self-destructive nature of sloth—making ridiculous excuses, performing comically inefficient actions, and ultimately bringing poverty and ruin upon himself. More than mere laziness, the sluggard represents a fundamental refusal to engage with God's created order through meaningful work.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The Sluggard reveals that sloth is not merely a personal failing but a rejection of humanity's creation mandate to cultivate and keep. His refusal to work represents a deeper spiritual malady—the unwillingness to participate in God's ongoing ordering of creation, leading inevitably to personal and social chaos.</div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Ant's Rebuke (Prov 6:6-11):</strong>
          The sluggard is told to observe the ant—a tiny creature with no overseer who nevertheless prepares for winter. The passage warns that poverty will come upon the sluggard like a bandit, suddenly and inevitably, because of his refusal to work when he should.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Irritating Inefficiency (Prov 10:26):</strong>
          "Like vinegar to teeth and smoke to eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him." His laziness doesn't just harm himself—it frustrates and damages those who depend on him, making him utterly unreliable.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Desire Without Action (Prov 13:4; 21:25-26):</strong>
          "The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing." He has desires and appetites like everyone else, but his refusal to work means they remain unfulfilled. His desire literally kills him because his hands refuse to labor.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Absurd Excuses (Prov 22:13; 26:13):</strong>
          "There's a lion outside! I'll be killed in the streets!" The sluggard invents increasingly ridiculous dangers to avoid leaving his house. The excuses become more elaborate: a lion not just outside, but specifically in the streets where work awaits.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Comic Inefficiency (Prov 19:24; 26:15):</strong>
          The sluggard buries his hand in the dish but is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth. This absurd image shows how sloth eventually destroys even the most basic self-care instincts.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Overgrown Field (Prov 24:30-34):</strong>
          A vivid parable of passing by the sluggard's field: thorns everywhere, ground covered with nettles, stone wall broken down. The observer learns a lesson about how "a little sleep, a little slumber" leads to poverty coming like an armed warrior.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Delusional Wisdom (Prov 26:16):</strong>
          The climax of absurdity: "The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer sensibly." His laziness has bred such self-deception that he considers himself wiser than multiple counselors.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The sluggard's portrait progresses from simple laziness to elaborate self-deception, from harming himself to burdening others, from physical inactivity to complete delusion—showing how sloth corrupts every aspect of human existence.</div>
