      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <div class="meta">
        <div class="kv"><strong>Scripture:</strong> Prov 1:22,32; 7:7; 8:5; 9:4,16; 14:15,18; 19:25; 21:11; 22:3; 27:12</div>
        <div class="kv"><strong>Hebrew:</strong> <span class="hebrew">פֶּתִי</span> (peti) "simple, naive, open"</div>
        <div class="kv"><strong>Etymology:</strong> From root פתה = "to be open, spacious, persuadable"</div>
        <div class="kv"><strong>Role:</strong> The inexperienced who can still choose wisdom</div>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Simple One represents the morally unformed—those who lack experience and discernment, making them vulnerable to both wisdom and folly. Unlike the fool who rejects wisdom or the scoffer who mocks it, the simple one simply doesn't know better yet. They stand at the crossroads, equally capable of becoming wise or foolish depending on whose voice they heed. Their openness is both their greatest vulnerability and their potential salvation.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The Simple One embodies humanity's liminal state—created for wisdom but vulnerable to deception. Their presence in Proverbs demonstrates God's grace in offering wisdom to the inexperienced and highlights the urgency of moral formation before naivety hardens into folly.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Loved by Folly (Prov 1:22):</strong>
          "How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?" The simple are content in their naivety, not recognizing their dangerous vulnerability. They don't actively seek wisdom because they don't know they need it.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Target of Seduction (Prov 7:6-23):</strong>
          The father observes "a young man lacking sense" approaching the adulteress's corner at twilight. The detailed narrative shows how the simple one's lack of discernment makes him easy prey: "With much seductive speech she persuades him... All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter."
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Called by Both Women (Prov 9:4, 16):</strong>
          Both Lady Wisdom and Lady Folly use identical words: "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" The simple stand at the ultimate crossroads, hearing competing invitations to life and death. Their simplicity makes them the primary audience for both voices.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Believing Everything (Prov 14:15):</strong>
          "The simple believes everything, but the prudent gives thought to his steps." Without developed discernment, the simple one accepts claims uncritically, unable to distinguish truth from deception.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Learning Through Consequences (Prov 19:25; 21:11):</strong>
          "Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence." The simple can learn wisdom either through direct instruction or by observing the consequences that befall fools and scoffers. They're still teachable.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Failure to Foresee (Prov 22:3; 27:12):</strong>
          "The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it." Lacking experience, they walk into obvious dangers that wisdom would have helped them avoid.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The simple one's journey reveals a critical window of opportunity—they can still choose wisdom before their simplicity calcifies into folly. Their story is one of urgent potential, where every encounter shapes their ultimate destiny.</div>
