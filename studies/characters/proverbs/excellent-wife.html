      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Excellent Wife (Eshet Chayil) of Proverbs 31:10-31 represents the book's climactic portrait of wisdom embodied in everyday life. Through an alphabetic acrostic poem, she demonstrates how divine wisdom translates into practical excellence across all spheres: economic enterprise, household management, community service, and spiritual devotion. Far from a mere domestic figure, she is entrepreneur, leader, teacher, and philanthropist—the living answer to Proverbs' opening question of how to live wisely.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> The Eshet Chayil functions as wisdom incarnate, demonstrating that the fear of the Lord produces tangible fruit in ordinary life. She embodies the fulfillment of Lady Wisdom's promises, showing that those who embrace wisdom create blessing that ripples through family, commerce, and community.</div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Portrait Through Action (Following the Acrostic)</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Her Value and Trust (vv. 10-12):</strong>
          The poem opens declaring her worth "far above rubies." Her husband trusts her completely (batach—the same word used for trusting God), and she brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. This establishes the foundation: trustworthiness and consistent beneficence.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Industry and Enterprise (vv. 13-19):</strong>
          She works with wool and flax, is like merchant ships bringing food from afar, rises before dawn to provide for her household, considers fields and buys them, plants vineyards from her earnings. Her arms are strong, her trading profitable, her lamp never goes out. This section reveals extensive economic activity and shrewd business acumen.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Compassion and Provision (vv. 20-22):</strong>
          She extends her hands to the poor and needy. When snow comes, she has no fear because her household is clothed in scarlet (double-layered garments). She makes coverings, and her clothing is fine linen and purple. Her provision extends from family to community, combining prosperity with generosity.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Honor and Wisdom (vv. 23-27):</strong>
          Her husband is respected at the city gate among the elders. She makes linen garments and sells them, supplies merchants with sashes. She is clothed with strength and dignity, laughs at the future, speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction (torah chesed) is on her tongue. Her influence extends to commerce and governance.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Praise and Fear of the Lord (vv. 28-31):</strong>
          Her children rise and bless her; her husband praises her above all women. The poem culminates with the declaration that charm is deceptive and beauty fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. She should receive the reward of her hands, and her works praise her at the city gates.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The acrostic structure presents comprehensive wisdom—from A to Z—showing that no area of life lies outside wisdom's domain. Her activities span private and public, economic and domestic, material and spiritual realms.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: HEBREW TERMINOLOGY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="hebrew-terms">
      <h3>Understanding "Eshet Chayil" - The Hebrew Terminology</h3>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>The Power of Chayil:</strong> The term חַיִל (chayil) fundamentally means strength, might, and valor. It's the same word used for mighty warriors (gibor chayil), military forces, and men of standing. When Scripture calls a woman "eshet chayil," it's attributing to her the same power, courage, and capability typically associated with warriors and influential leaders.
      </div>
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📜 The Word "Chayil" (חַיִל) in Context</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Military:</strong> Army, force, host of warriors (Exod 14:4)</li>
            <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Power, might, ability (Ps 18:32)</li>
            <li><strong>Wealth:</strong> Resources, riches, substance (Gen 34:29)</li>
            <li><strong>Virtue:</strong> Moral strength, excellence (Prov 12:4)</li>
            <li><strong>Capability:</strong> Efficiency, competence (Gen 47:6)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This multifaceted word reveals she possesses warrior-like strength applied to every sphere of life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔥 Cultural Significance</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sabbath Tradition:</strong> Jewish husbands sing Proverbs 31 to wives every Friday evening</li>
            <li><strong>Title of Honor:</strong> Ruth also called "eshet chayil" (Ruth 3:11)</li>
            <li><strong>Not Diminutive:</strong> "Virtuous woman" undersells it—she's a "woman of valor"</li>
            <li><strong>Gender Equality:</strong> Same term for male and female excellence</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The designation places her among the valiant ones of Israel, not merely the good or virtuous.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Translation Challenge:</strong> English translations like "excellent wife" or "virtuous woman" fail to capture the military overtones and raw power in the Hebrew. "Woman of valor" better conveys that she's a force to be reckoned with—strong, capable, wealthy, and morally courageous. She doesn't merely manage a household; she conquers life's challenges with warrior-like strength.
