      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>First Call at the Gates (Prov 1:20-33):</strong>
          Lady Wisdom appears as a prophet in public spaces—streets, squares, and city gates—crying out against those who reject knowledge. She warns of coming disaster for those who ignore her call, yet promises security to those who listen. This inaugural appearance establishes her public, urgent, and universal mission.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Blessing of Finding Wisdom (Prov 3:13-20):</strong>
          The father's speech celebrates those who find wisdom, describing her as more precious than jewels. The passage reveals wisdom's role in creation: through wisdom Yahweh founded the earth and established the heavens. This cosmic foundation grounds wisdom's practical value in divine activity.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Great Speech (Prov 8:1-36):</strong>
          Lady Wisdom delivers her central theological discourse from the crossroads and city heights. She declares her value, her role in just leadership, and most significantly, her presence with God before and during creation. She was the first of God's works, his daily delight, rejoicing in the inhabited world and delighting in humanity.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Banquet Invitation (Prov 9:1-6):</strong>
          Lady Wisdom builds her seven-pillared house and prepares a feast, sending servants to invite the simple to her table. "Leave your simple ways and live," she calls, offering bread and wine to those who accept her hospitality. This final appearance presents wisdom as generous host, offering life through communion.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Lady Wisdom's appearances move from warning prophet to cosmic revealer to generous host, progressively unveiling wisdom's nature as both transcendent truth and practical guidance accessible through relationship and community.</div>
