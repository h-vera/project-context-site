    <!-- NARRATIVE JOURNEY TIMELINE -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="creation">
      <h3>1. "Not Good" & the Need for a Counterpart (Genesis 2:18–20)</h3>
      <p>The Eden story moves from the refrain of "good" to the first declaration of "not good": <em>"It is not good for the human (hā-ʾādām) to be alone"</em> (Gen 2:18). God responds not by creating another animal but by fashioning a <strong>partner of corresponding strength</strong> (<em>ʿēzer kĕnegdô</em>).</p>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Divine Assessment:</strong> The Hebrew <em>ʿēzer</em> is often used of God as Israel's help in battle (Deut 33:7; Ps 121:1–2), indicating not subordination but vital strength. <em>Kenegdô</em> ("according to what is opposite him") conveys complementarity and equality. God's two-stage process—first bringing animals, then creating woman—awakens in Adam an awareness of his need for a true counterpart.
      </div>

      <p>The parade of animals serves a pedagogical purpose: Adam names each creature, exercising his royal authority, yet finds no <em>ʿēzer kĕnegdô</em> among them. This heightens the anticipation and significance of what God will do next.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="built">
      <h3>2. Built from the Side: One Flesh Union (Genesis 2:21–25)</h3>
      <p>The text uses the unusual verb <strong>bānâ</strong> ("to build") for the woman's creation, the same verb used in temple-building (Exod 25–40). This word choice hints that Eve is not merely fashioned biologically but represents the <strong>sanctuary architecture</strong> of Eden itself. Just as God builds the tabernacle for his presence, so he "builds" the woman to complete humanity's vocation as the living temple of God.</p>

      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Deep Sleep (tardēmâ):</strong> 
          God causes a supernatural sleep—the same word used when God makes covenant with Abraham (Gen 15:12). This is sacred, visionary space where God acts sovereignly.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Side (ṣēlāʿ):</strong> 
          Often mistranslated "rib," this word typically refers to the side of sacred architecture—the ark (Exod 25:12), the tabernacle (Exod 26:20), or the temple (1 Kgs 6:5). Eve is formed from Adam's architectural "side," signaling unity and sacred purpose.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Poetic Exclamation:</strong> 
          Adam bursts into poetry—the Bible's first recorded human words: <em>"This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman (ʾiššâ), because she was taken out of Man (ʾîš)."</em> The wordplay emphasizes correspondence and delight.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>One Flesh Covenant:</strong> 
          The narrative establishes the paradigm: <em>"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh"</em> (Gen 2:24). Paul later interprets this as a mystery pointing to Christ and the church (Eph 5:31–32).
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Temple Symbolism:</strong> Eve's creation portrays humanity's original calling as royal priests in God's garden-temple. The side imagery and temple-building language signal that their union is sacred architecture. Marriage here is a micro-Eden: a unity designed to extend God's blessing outward.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="temptation">
      <h3>3. The Serpent & the Redefinition of Good (Genesis 3:1–7)</h3>
      <p>Into this harmony enters the <strong>serpent</strong> (<em>nāḥāš</em>), described as <em>ʿārûm</em> ("shrewd, cunning"). The word echoes <em>ʿărummîm</em> ("naked" from 2:25), linking their innocence with the serpent's craftiness. In ancient Near Eastern symbolism, serpents were associated with wisdom, underworld power, and immortality.</p>

      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Question (3:1):</strong> 
          <em>"Did God really say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'?"</em> The serpent's opening gambit distorts God's generous provision into restrictive prohibition.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Eve's Response (3:2–3):</strong> 
          Eve corrects the serpent but adds to God's command: <em>"neither shall you touch it."</em> Her words reveal how divine instruction was already being refracted, perhaps through Adam's transmission.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Denial (3:4–5):</strong> 
          <em>"You will not surely die... you will be like God, knowing good and evil."</em> The serpent reframes God's protection as deprivation, promising autonomous wisdom.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Taking (3:6):</strong> 
          Eve sees the tree as: (1) good for food, (2) delight to the eyes, (3) desirable to make one wise. This triadic formula of desire appears throughout Scripture (cf. 1 John 2:16). She takes, eats, and gives to Adam, "who was with her."
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Eyes Opened (3:7):</strong> 
          Their eyes are opened—not to divine wisdom but to shame. They sew fig leaves to cover themselves, signaling rupture within themselves and with one another. Innocence (<em>ʿărummîm</em>) is replaced with alienation.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Wisdom Crisis:</strong> The Fall is not mere disobedience but a wisdom crisis. Eve and Adam seize the right to define good and evil, inaugurating humanity's tragic quest for autonomy. The literary irony is sharp: humans, already God's image-bearers, grasp for what they already possess—to "be like God."
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="consequences">
      <h3>4. Divine Confrontation & Consequences (Genesis 3:8–19)</h3>
      <p>God walks in the garden "at the time of the evening breeze" (or "wind/spirit of the day"). Instead of joyous communion, the humans hide. The scene unfolds as both judicial proceeding and divine lament.</p>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>The Interrogation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>To Adam:</strong> "Where are you?" (3:9)</li>
            <li><strong>Adam's response:</strong> Blame-shifts to Eve and implicitly to God: "The woman whom you gave..." (3:12)</li>
            <li><strong>To Eve:</strong> "What is this you have done?" (3:13)</li>
            <li><strong>Eve's response:</strong> "The serpent deceived me" (3:13)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The pattern of blame reveals fractured relationships—with God, with each other, with creation.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>The Sentences</h4>
          <p><strong>To the Serpent (3:14–15):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cursed above all animals</li>
            <li>On belly, eating dust (humiliation)</li>
            <li>Perpetual enmity with woman's seed</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>To the Woman (3:16):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Multiplied pain in childbearing</li>
            <li>Desire for husband; he will rule</li>
            <li>Relational harmony distorted</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>To the Man (3:17–19):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ground cursed; painful toil</li>
            <li>Thorns and thistles</li>
            <li>Return to dust</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Divine Lament:</strong> These speeches function as both judicial curse and divine lament. God mourns the distortion of his creation. The poetic form (parallelism, wordplay, rhythm) resembles later prophetic laments over Israel's exile (Lam 1; Isa 24), showing God's grief as much as his judgment.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="promise">
      <h3>5. The Proto-Evangelium: First Gospel Promise (Genesis 3:15)</h3>
      <p>Amid judgment shines a note of hope. God declares to the serpent:</p>
      
      <blockquote style="background: #f8f9ff; border-left: 4px solid #4a5fff; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <em>"I will put enmity between you and the woman,<br>
        and between your offspring and her offspring;<br>
        he shall bruise your head,<br>
        and you shall bruise his heel."</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This "proto-evangelium" (first gospel) reverberates throughout Scripture:</p>
      
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>Immediate Context</h4>
          <p>Promise spoken to the woman, not the man. Eve becomes the channel of hope despite her role in transgression.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>OT Development</h4>
          <p>Isaiah's servant songs echo the wounded victor theme. The seed promise structures genealogies and messianic hope.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>NT Fulfillment</h4>
          <p>Rom 16:20: "The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet." Rev 12: Woman's child defeats the dragon.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Early Christian interpreters saw Mary as the "new Eve": her obedience countering Eve's deception (Irenaeus, <em>Against Heresies</em> 3.22.4). The promise centers redemption through the woman's line.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="motherhood">
      <h3>6. Life Beyond Eden: Eve as Mother (Genesis 3:20–4:25)</h3>
      
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Named Ḥavvah (3:20):</strong> 
          After receiving judgment, Adam names his wife Eve (Ḥavvah, "life/living"), a hope-laden act. Despite death's entrance, she will be "mother of all living." The name itself is prophetic resistance against the curse.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Divine Clothing (3:21):</strong> 
          God makes garments of skin and clothes them—an act of provision that foreshadows sacrifice and covering. Even in judgment, divine care continues.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Exile Eastward (3:22–24):</strong> 
          The couple is expelled from Eden. Cherubim with a flaming sword guard the way to the tree of life, imagery that will reappear in tabernacle/temple design where cherubim guard the Holy of Holies.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Birth of Cain (4:1):</strong> 
          Eve's first recorded words after Eden: <em>"I have acquired (qānîtî) a man with the help of the LORD."</em> She recognizes divine partnership in life-giving, perhaps hoping this child is the promised seed.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Birth of Abel (4:2):</strong> 
          The second son's name (hebel, "vapor, fleeting") foreshadows tragedy. The pattern of sibling rivalry begins, echoing the serpent's challenge to divine order.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Murder & Exile (4:3–16):</strong> 
          Cain kills Abel—the seed of violence spreads. Yet God preserves Cain with a protective mark, showing mercy even in judgment.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Birth of Seth (4:25):</strong> 
          Eve bears another son: <em>"God has appointed for me another offspring instead of Abel."</em> Through Seth, the covenant line continues. Genesis 4:26 notes that in Seth's time, people "began to call upon the name of the LORD."
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Paradox of Motherhood:</strong> Eve's motherhood is both bitter and hopeful. She embodies the paradox of human life east of Eden: pain and rivalry alongside divine provision and covenant continuity. Through Seth, the "seed" line is preserved, ensuring that exile does not erase God's promise.
      </div>

  <div class="key-insight">
    <strong>Archetypal Significance:</strong> Genesis presents Eve's story not as an isolated failure but as the archetype of human history. Every rivalry, deception, and exile echoes Eden, but so does every preserved line of promise. Her narrative becomes the seedbed for Israel's story and the anticipation of Christ's victory.

      <h3>Poetic Elements in Eve's Story</h3>
      
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>Adam's Exclamation (2:23)</h4>
          <p>The Bible's first recorded human words are poetry:</p>
          <blockquote style="font-style: italic; margin: 1rem 0;">
            "This at last is bone of my bones<br>
            and flesh of my flesh;<br>
            she shall be called Woman,<br>
            because she was taken out of Man."
          </blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> bone/flesh intensifies unity</li>
            <li><strong>Wordplay:</strong> ʾîš/ʾiššâ highlights correspondence</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> "not good" resolved with joy</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Divine Oracles (3:14–19)</h4>
          <p>God's speeches are highly poetic, marked by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Hebrew poetic structure</li>
            <li><strong>Wordplay:</strong> Sound patterns and repetition</li>
            <li><strong>Chiasm:</strong> ground → toil → plants → toil → ground → dust</li>
            <li><strong>Lament form:</strong> Grief alongside judgment</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These resemble later prophetic oracles and laments (Lamentations, Isaiah 24).</p>

  <h3>Eve's Echo Through Genesis</h3>
  
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div>
      <h4>Direct Narrative Connections</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cain & Abel → Jacob & Esau (Gen 25-27):</strong> Sibling rivalry, deception with food and garments. Eve's line fractured repeats in later patriarchal stories.</li>
        <li><strong>Cain & Abel → Joseph & Brothers (Gen 37):</strong> Jealousy over favor, plot to kill, but preservation of the chosen seed.</li>
        <li><strong>Eve's pain in childbirth → Patriarchal barrenness:</strong> Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel all struggle with fertility, echoing Eve's paradox of life through pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Tree of knowledge → Trees in patriarchal narratives:</strong> Abraham's oaks, Jacob's dream under tree, Judah and Tamar by the road.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Thematic Parallels</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deception with garments:</strong> Fig leaves (Gen 3) → Animal skins (Gen 3:21) → Jacob's goat skins (Gen 27) → Joseph's coat (Gen 37)</li>
        <li><strong>East of Eden motif:</strong> Humanity moves east (3:24) → Cain goes further east (4:16) → Tower of Babel in east (11:2) → Abraham called westward (12:1)</li>
        <li><strong>Wisdom/folly choices:</strong> Eve's desire for wisdom → Sarah's plan with Hagar → Rebekah's favoritism → Rachel's mandrakes</li>
      </ul>
