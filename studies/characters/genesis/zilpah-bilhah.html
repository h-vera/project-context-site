      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Zilpah and Bilhah were handmaids given by Laban to his daughters Leah and Rachel, respectively. During the fertility rivalry between the sisters, each was given to Jacob as a secondary wife to bear children on their mistresses' behalf. Together they became mothers to four of Israel's twelve tribes, demonstrating God's providence working through marginalized women.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Despite their lowly status and lack of voice in the narrative, Zilpah and Bilhah's sons became full tribal patriarchs of Israel, illustrating God's pattern of including the marginalized in covenant promises and working through human schemes to accomplish divine purposes.

    <!-- SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Given as Handmaids (Genesis 29:24, 29):</strong>
          Laban gives Zilpah to Leah and Bilhah to Rachel as wedding gifts when each daughter marries Jacob. This establishes their initial status as property rather than persons with agency.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Bilhah Bears Dan and Naphtali (Genesis 30:3-8):</strong>
          Rachel, barren and desperate, gives Bilhah to Jacob as a wife. Bilhah bears Dan ("he judged") and Naphtali ("my struggle"), with Rachel naming them to reflect her rivalry with Leah.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Zilpah Bears Gad and Asher (Genesis 30:9-13):</strong>
          When Leah stops bearing children, she gives Zilpah to Jacob. Zilpah bears Gad ("good fortune") and Asher ("happy"), with Leah's naming reflecting her perceived victory in the fertility competition.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Bilhah's Violation by Reuben (Genesis 35:22):</strong>
          After Rachel's death, Reuben sleeps with Bilhah, an act that costs him his birthright and preeminence. This violation highlights Bilhah's vulnerability as a concubine after her mistress's death.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Genealogical Recognition (Genesis 46:18, 25):</strong>
          Both women are listed in the genealogy of Jacob's family going to Egypt, acknowledging their role as mothers of four tribes despite their subordinate status.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The narrative reveals a pattern of women used as pawns in family rivalries, yet God elevates their offspring to equal status with the sons of the primary wives, subverting social hierarchies.
      </div>
    </div>
