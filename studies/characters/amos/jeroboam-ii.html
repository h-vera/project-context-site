      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Jeroboam II presided over the longest and most prosperous reign in the Northern Kingdom's history—41 years of territorial expansion, economic growth, and military success unmatched since Solomon. Yet the biblical verdict is devastating: "He did evil in the eyes of the LORD" (2 Kgs 14:24). His reign represents the paradox of worldly success masking spiritual failure. The prophets Amos and Hosea condemned the systemic injustice, religious hypocrisy, and idolatry that flourished under his prosperous rule, announcing that divine judgment was imminent despite—and because of—Israel's apparent blessing.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Jeroboam II embodies the biblical warning that material prosperity is not evidence of divine approval. His reign demonstrates that national success can coexist with—and even mask—covenant unfaithfulness. The prophets' condemnation of his era establishes that God measures kingdoms not by GDP but by justice, and that great calling brings great accountability.

         SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Royal Succession (2 Kings 14:23):</strong>
          Jeroboam II came to the throne as co-regent with his father Joash around 793 BCE, becoming sole ruler after Joash's death c. 782 BCE. As the fourth king of the Jehu dynasty, he inherited a kingdom that had suffered under Aramean (Syrian) oppression but was poised for recovery as Assyrian pressure weakened Damascus.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Territorial Restoration (2 Kings 14:25, 28):</strong>
          Jeroboam "restored the border of Israel from Lebo-hamath to the Sea of the Arabah"—boundaries not seen since Solomon's reign. He recovered Damascus and Hamath, regions that had long been under Aramean control. The prophet Jonah son of Amittai prophesied this restoration, identifying Jeroboam as an instrument of divine deliverance despite his spiritual failures.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Economic Prosperity:</strong>
          Archaeological evidence confirms unprecedented wealth during Jeroboam's reign: the Samaria Ostraca document efficient olive oil and wine trade, ivory decorations adorned elite homes, and population density reached its peak. Trade flourished with Egypt and Assyria. Yet Amos condemned this prosperity as built on exploitation—"beds of ivory" purchased through oppressing the poor.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Prophetic Confrontation (Amos 7:9–11):</strong>
          Amos prophesied against "the house of Jeroboam" with the sword, prompting Amaziah the priest to report to the king that "Amos has conspired against you." The accusation that "the land cannot bear all his words" reveals how threatening the prophetic message was to the established order. Jeroboam's response is unrecorded, but Amos was not silenced.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Death and Aftermath (2 Kings 14:29; 15:8–12):</strong>
          Jeroboam "rested with his fathers"—dying peacefully despite Amos's warnings about the sword coming upon his house. His son Zechariah reigned only six months before being assassinated by Shallum, fulfilling the prophecy against Jeroboam's dynasty. Within 30 years of Jeroboam's death, Israel itself would fall to Assyria (722 BCE).
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Narrative Pattern:</strong> Jeroboam II's story follows a tragic pattern: divine deliverance squandered through persistent idolatry. God raised him up as "savior" (2 Kgs 14:27), yet he perpetuated the sins of his namesake Jeroboam I. His prosperity became the occasion for deeper corruption rather than grateful obedience—a warning about the spiritual dangers of success.

         SECTION 3: LITERARY CONTEXT
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="literary-context">
      <h3>Literary Context & Structure</h3>
      <div class="grid-4">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📚 Position in Kings</h4>
          <p>Jeroboam II receives surprisingly brief treatment in 2 Kings (only 7 verses) despite his 41-year reign—the longest in Israel's history. This literary compression highlights the author's theological rather than political interests: worldly success without covenant faithfulness merits minimal attention.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Literary Patterns</h4>
          <p>The formulaic judgment "he did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat" links all northern kings to the original apostasy at Dan and Bethel. Jeroboam II's very name echoes this founding failure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🎭 Character Function</h4>
          <p>In the prophetic books, Jeroboam II functions as the representative of prosperous unfaithfulness. He is named in the superscriptions of both Amos and Hosea, framing their entire prophetic corpus as addressed to his era of deceptive blessing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>✍️ Narrative Techniques</h4>
          <p>The tension between Jonah's positive prophecy of restoration (2 Kgs 14:25) and Amos/Hosea's judgment oracles creates interpretive complexity—God can use a wicked king as instrument of deliverance while simultaneously condemning his reign.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="significance">
        <h4>Intertextual Connections</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Jeroboam I (1 Kings 12):</strong> The name deliberately echoes Israel's founding apostate king; Jeroboam II continues the same idolatrous worship system</li>
          <li><strong>Solomon's boundaries:</strong> The restored borders (2 Kgs 14:25) recall Solomon's empire, suggesting a "second Solomon" who shares both glory and apostasy</li>
          <li><strong>Jehu's dynasty (2 Kings 10):</strong> Jeroboam II is the fulfillment of God's promise that Jehu's descendants would reign to the fourth generation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- ==========================================
         SECTION 4: THEOLOGICAL THEMES
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="themes">
      <h3>Major Theological Themes</h3>
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div>
          <h4>💰 Prosperity & Spiritual Danger</h4>
          <p>Jeroboam II's reign illustrates the biblical warning that wealth can breed complacency and injustice. The prophets condemned Israel for attributing their prosperity to Baal rather than Yahweh, and for using their abundance to exploit rather than bless the vulnerable.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Success Without Faithfulness</h4>
          <p>Military victories, territorial expansion, and economic growth—all present under Jeroboam II—do not equal divine approval. The biblical authors evaluate his reign as "evil" despite its worldly achievements, establishing that God's standards differ radically from human measures of success.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>🏛️ Institutional Idolatry</h4>
          <p>Jeroboam II maintained the golden calf worship at Dan and Bethel established by his namesake, demonstrating how institutional religion can persist generation after generation even when it contradicts covenant requirements. The system had become self-perpetuating.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-3" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        <div>
          <h4>🦁 Divine Patience & Judgment</h4>
          <p>God's use of Jeroboam II as deliverer (2 Kgs 14:27) shows divine patience—"the LORD had not said that he would blot out the name of Israel." Yet this patience has limits; Amos announces that the end has come. Grace delayed is not grace denied its purpose.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>👑 Kingship Failure</h4>
          <p>Israel's kings were meant to embody Torah, promoting justice and covenant faithfulness. Jeroboam II's reign represents the complete failure of this ideal—the king prospers while the poor are sold for silver and justice is perverted at the gate.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>📜 Prophetic Witness</h4>
          <p>Four prophets ministered during Jeroboam's reign: Jonah, Hosea, Amos, and possibly Joel. This concentration of prophetic activity signals the urgency of Israel's situation—God multiplied His messengers as judgment approached.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

         SECTION 5: ANE CONTEXT
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="ane-context">
      <h3>Ancient Near Eastern Context</h3>
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📜 Historical Context</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Assyrian weakness:</strong> The early 8th century saw Assyria focused elsewhere, creating a power vacuum that allowed Israel and Judah to expand</li>
            <li><strong>Damascus decline:</strong> Assyrian campaigns under Adad-nirari III (c. 796 BCE) weakened Aram-Damascus, Israel's traditional rival, enabling Jeroboam's conquests</li>
            <li><strong>Trade networks:</strong> Archaeological evidence shows extensive olive oil and wine trade with Egypt and Assyria, confirming the biblical picture of prosperity</li>
            <li><strong>The earthquake:</strong> Both Amos and Zechariah reference a major earthquake during Jeroboam's reign (c. 760 BCE), confirmed by archaeological evidence at multiple sites</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>⚡ Archaeological Evidence</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Samaria Ostraca:</strong> 63 inscribed potsherds from Samaria document wine and oil shipments, revealing palace bureaucracy and economic administration</li>
            <li><strong>Seal of Shema:</strong> A bronze seal discovered at Megiddo reads "Shema, servant of Jeroboam," confirming his historicity and administrative reach</li>
            <li><strong>Population density:</strong> The late 8th century saw Israel's territory at its most densely populated (estimated 350,000), confirming prosperity</li>
            <li><strong>Ivory decorations:</strong> Excavations at Samaria reveal the "beds of ivory" and luxury goods condemned by Amos (3:15; 6:4)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Cultural Bridge:</strong> Jeroboam II's reign represents Israel's last golden age before Assyrian conquest. The prosperity was real—archaeologically verifiable—making the prophetic critique all the more striking. Amos and Hosea did not condemn imaginary sins but exposed the injustice hiding beneath genuine national success.
      </div>

         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="biblical-theology">
      <h3>Creation, Fall & Redemption Patterns</h3>
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🌍 Creation/Blessing Echoes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Restored boundaries "from Lebo-hamath to the Sea of the Arabah" echo Solomonic (and thus Edenic) fullness—land promises seemingly fulfilled</li>
            <li>Agricultural abundance (oil, wine, grain) reflects creational blessing, yet is hoarded by the wealthy rather than shared</li>
            <li>Population growth and territorial expansion mirror the Genesis mandate to "fill the earth"—but without righteousness</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>🍎 Fall Patterns</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Prosperity breeds the self-deception of Eden's serpent: "You will not surely die"—Israel assumed blessing meant immunity from judgment</li>
            <li>The exploitation of the poor inverts creation's purpose: image-bearers are commodified "for a pair of sandals"</li>
            <li>Idolatry at Dan and Bethel continues humanity's primal rebellion—exchanging the Creator for created things</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-highlight" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        <h4>✨ Redemption Through Judgment</h4>
        <p>Jeroboam II's reign demonstrates that God's patience serves redemptive purposes—but patience exhausted leads to purifying judgment. The Assyrian exile that came 30 years after his death would become the crucible through which a remnant emerged, chastened and ready for restoration.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>God raised up Jeroboam as "savior" (2 Kgs 14:27)—even wicked instruments serve divine purposes</li>
          <li>The prophetic warnings during his reign were acts of grace, offering opportunity for repentance</li>
          <li>The fall of his dynasty (Zechariah's assassination) began the rapid collapse that ended in exile</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

         SECTION 7: MESSIANIC
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="messianic">
      <h3>Messianic Trajectory & Christ Connections</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Anti-Type of the True King:</strong>
          Jeroboam II represents everything the Messiah would reverse. Where Jeroboam's prosperity masked injustice, Messiah would bring righteousness. Where Jeroboam perpetuated idolatry, Messiah would restore true worship. Where Jeroboam's kingdom fell, Messiah's kingdom would endure forever.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The Failed Shepherd-King:</strong>
          Israel's kings were meant to shepherd God's people (Ezek 34). Jeroboam II's reign—prosperous for elites, devastating for the poor—exemplifies the failed shepherds whom the True Shepherd would replace. Jesus's concern for the marginalized directly contrasts with Jeroboam's complicity in exploitation.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Amos 9:11 Fulfillment:</strong>
          The "booth of David" that falls after Jeroboam's dynasty collapses will be raised up in Christ. James cites this at the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15:16–17) as fulfilled in Messiah's kingdom—the restoration Jeroboam's reign promised but could never deliver.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Christological Significance:</strong> Jeroboam II's reign represents the pinnacle and failure of human kingship in Israel. His prosperity without righteousness, success without faithfulness, and blessing without justice highlight why Israel needed a different kind of king—one who would embody rather than violate Torah, one whose kingdom would be characterized by justice rolling down like waters.

          <h4>🙏 Personal Application</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Success ≠ Approval:</strong> Material prosperity is not evidence of spiritual health; examine the fruit of your life by God's standards, not the world's</li>
            <li><strong>Comfort Danger:</strong> Jeroboam's era bred complacency; prosperity can dull sensitivity to sin and need for God</li>
            <li><strong>Stewardship Question:</strong> How do we use the resources God provides? For self-indulgence or for justice and generosity?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>⛪ Community Application</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Institutional Evaluation:</strong> Churches can prosper numerically and financially while failing spiritually—growth metrics aren't the measure</li>
            <li><strong>Prophetic Listening:</strong> Jeroboam's Israel rejected Amos; do our communities welcome or silence uncomfortable prophetic voices?</li>
            <li><strong>Justice Audit:</strong> Who benefits from our community's prosperity? Who is marginalized or exploited?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        <strong>Contemporary Challenge:</strong> Jeroboam II's reign challenges any assumption that national prosperity indicates divine favor or that economic growth justifies overlooking injustice. In an era of unprecedented global wealth alongside persistent inequality, his story asks: What would the prophets say about our prosperity?

      <h3>Study Questions</h3>
      <ol class="question-list">
        <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Why does the author of 2 Kings give only 7 verses to Israel's longest-reigning and most prosperous king?</li>
        <li><strong>Theological:</strong> How do we reconcile God using Jeroboam II as "deliverer" (2 Kgs 14:27) while simultaneously condemning him as evil?</li>
        <li><strong>Prophetic:</strong> Compare Jonah's positive prophecy about Jeroboam (2 Kgs 14:25) with Amos's condemnation. How can both be true?</li>
        <li><strong>Application:</strong> What warning does Jeroboam's reign offer to prosperous churches, nations, or individuals today?</li>
        <li><strong>Connections:</strong> How does Jeroboam II's reign prepare us to understand why Israel needed a different kind of king—the Messiah?</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="discussion-prompt">
        <h4>Small Group Discussion</h4>
        <p>Consider discussing: By what metrics do we typically evaluate success—personal, ecclesial, or national? How might the prophetic perspective challenge those metrics?</p>
