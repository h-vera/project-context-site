      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Amaziah appears in only eight verses of Scripture, yet he represents one of the most significant confrontations in prophetic literature. As priest of Bethel—the royal sanctuary established by Jeroboam I to rival Jerusalem's temple—he served an idolatrous cult while bearing a name praising Yahweh. When Amos's message threatened the stability of Jeroboam II's regime, Amaziah reported him to the king as a conspirator and ordered him to leave. His accusations distorted Amos's words, and his dismissive challenge prompted Amos's most explicit statement of prophetic calling—and a devastating personal oracle of judgment.</p>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Theological Significance:</strong> Amaziah embodies the corruption that occurs when religion serves political power rather than divine truth. He represents every religious leader who prioritizes institutional stability over prophetic witness, who conflates national interest with divine will, and who silences uncomfortable truth rather than repenting before it. His confrontation with Amos dramatizes the perennial conflict between establishment religion and prophetic challenge.

         SECTION 2: NARRATIVE JOURNEY
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="narrative">
      <h3>Narrative Journey</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Context: Amos's Third Vision (Amos 7:7–9):</strong>
          Immediately before Amaziah's appearance, Amos receives the vision of the plumb line—God measuring Israel and finding it crooked, with no reprieve this time. The vision specifically mentions judgment on "the house of Jeroboam with the sword" (7:9). This direct threat to the royal dynasty triggers Amaziah's response.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Report to the King (Amos 7:10–11):</strong>
          Amaziah sent word to Jeroboam II: "Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words." He then summarizes Amos's message: "Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel must go into exile." Notably, Amaziah misquotes Amos—the prophet had spoken of "the house of Jeroboam" (the dynasty), not Jeroboam personally dying by the sword.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Confrontation with Amos (Amos 7:12–13):</strong>
          Amaziah addresses Amos as "seer" (<span class="hebrew">חֹזֶה</span>, ḥōzeh)—perhaps sarcastically, perhaps acknowledging his visionary experiences. He commands Amos: "Flee away to the land of Judah. There eat bread, and prophesy there." His reasoning reveals his theology: "But never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom."
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Amos's Response (Amos 7:14–15):</strong>
          Amos answers with his famous declaration of prophetic calling: "I was no prophet, nor a prophet's son, but I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs. And the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'" His authority comes not from professional training but from divine commission.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Oracle Against Amaziah (Amos 7:16–17):</strong>
          Amos turns the tables with devastating precision. Because Amaziah said "Do not prophesy against Israel," he receives a personal oracle: his wife will become a prostitute in the city, his sons and daughters will fall by the sword, his land will be divided by measuring line, and he himself will die in an unclean land. The very exile he wanted Amos silenced about will consume his own family.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Narrative Pattern:</strong> The confrontation follows a chiastic pattern: Amaziah accuses Amos to the king (A), Amaziah commands Amos to leave (B), Amos declares his divine calling (B'), Amos prophesies against Amaziah (A'). The center highlights the contrast: Amaziah speaks for the king; Amos speaks for the LORD.
      </div>

         SECTION 3: LITERARY CONTEXT
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="literary-context">
      <h3>Literary Context & Structure</h3>
      <div class="grid-4">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>📚 Position in Book</h4>
          <p>The Amaziah confrontation is strategically placed between the third and fourth visions (7:7–9 and 8:1–3), interrupting the vision sequence with narrative. This placement connects Amos's prophetic experience with the real-world opposition it provoked—visions have consequences.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🔄 Literary Patterns</h4>
          <p>Amaziah's language reveals his priorities: "king's sanctuary" and "temple of the kingdom" (7:13). He never mentions Yahweh. His titles for Bethel locate authority in human kingship, not divine presence. The contrast with Amos's "the LORD took me... the LORD said to me" is stark.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🎭 Character Function</h4>
          <p>Amaziah functions as the embodiment of institutional religion opposed to prophetic truth. He represents the religious establishment that benefits from the status quo and therefore resists any message of judgment. He is antagonist to Amos and, more fundamentally, to Yahweh himself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>✍️ Narrative Techniques</h4>
          <p>The narrator gives Amaziah no interior motivation—we hear only his words and see only his actions. This narrative restraint lets readers evaluate him by his speech alone. His misquotation of Amos (v. 11) subtly signals his unreliability.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="significance">
        <h4>Intertextual Connections</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 Kings 12:31:</strong> Jeroboam I "made priests from among all the people who were not of the sons of Levi"—Amaziah may have been such an illegitimate appointee, explaining his political rather than spiritual orientation</li>
          <li><strong>Jeremiah 26:</strong> The prophet faces similar accusations of conspiracy against the king; religious establishment versus prophetic word is a recurring biblical pattern</li>
          <li><strong>1 Kings 13:</strong> An earlier anonymous prophet at Bethel confronted Jeroboam I at the same altar; Amos continues this tradition of prophetic challenge at Bethel</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

         SECTION 4: THEOLOGICAL THEMES
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="themes">
      <h3>Major Theological Themes</h3>
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div>
          <h4>🏛️ Political Religion</h4>
          <p>Amaziah explicitly identifies Bethel as "the king's sanctuary" and "temple of the kingdom"—not Yahweh's house. His religion serves royal interests. When prophetic truth threatens political stability, he chooses politics over truth. This conflation of divine and royal authority corrupts both.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>💰 Prophetic Economics</h4>
          <p>Amaziah's taunt—"Earn your bread there [in Judah] and prophesy there"—assumes Amos prophesies for money. He cannot conceive of prophetic ministry apart from financial motivation. This mercenary view of prophecy blinds him to genuine divine calling.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>🔇 Silencing Truth</h4>
          <p>Amaziah's strategy is to relocate Amos—move the troublesome message elsewhere rather than respond to its content. This pattern of silencing rather than engaging recurs throughout history whenever prophetic voices challenge comfortable corruption.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-3" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        <div>
          <h4>⚡ Divine Calling vs. Institutional Authority</h4>
          <p>Amaziah has institutional authority—he is "the priest of Bethel," the chief religious official. Amos has only divine calling—"the LORD took me." The confrontation establishes that divine commission trumps institutional credential. God's word cannot be silenced by human office.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>🎭 Ironic Naming</h4>
          <p>Amaziah's name means "Yahweh is mighty"—yet he serves a cult that rivals Yahweh's worship and tries to silence Yahweh's prophet. The irony cuts deep: he bears the name of the God whose messenger he opposes. His name condemns him.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Personal Judgment</h4>
          <p>Amos's oracle against Amaziah (7:17) demonstrates that opposing prophetic truth brings personal consequences. The priest who tried to silence the message of exile will see his own family destroyed by exile. Resistance to God's word does not escape God's judgment.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- ==========================================
         SECTION 5: ANE CONTEXT
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="ane-context">
      <h3>Ancient Near Eastern Context</h3>
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>📜 ANE Priesthood & Prophecy</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Court prophets:</strong> Throughout the ANE, prophets often served at royal pleasure, delivering messages the king wanted to hear; Amaziah assumes Amos operates similarly</li>
            <li><strong>Temple economics:</strong> Temples were economic centers; priests benefited financially from worship; Amaziah's assumption about prophetic income reflects this reality</li>
            <li><strong>Royal sanctuaries:</strong> Kings throughout the ANE established temples to legitimate their rule; Bethel functioned similarly for the northern monarchy</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>⚡ Biblical Distinctives</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Prophetic independence:</strong> Unlike ANE court prophets, Israel's true prophets spoke against royal interests when God's word demanded it</li>
            <li><strong>Non-professional calling:</strong> Amos's insistence that he was "no prophet, nor a prophet's son" distinguishes him from professional prophetic guilds</li>
            <li><strong>Divine commission:</strong> The formula "the LORD took me... the LORD said to me" locates authority in divine encounter, not institutional appointment</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Cultural Bridge:</strong> Amaziah operated within the normal expectations of ANE religious politics—prophets served kings, temples served royal ideology, and religious officials protected institutional interests. Amos's refusal to fit this pattern exposed the radical nature of Yahweh's prophetic word: it serves no human master and cannot be bought, silenced, or controlled.
      </div>

         SECTION 6: BIBLICAL THEOLOGY
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="biblical-theology">
      <h3>Creation, Fall & Redemption Patterns</h3>
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h4>🍎 Fall Patterns</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Amaziah's preference for royal approval over divine truth echoes the original sin—choosing human wisdom over God's word</li>
            <li>His distortion of Amos's message mirrors the serpent's strategy: misquoting and twisting God's word to serve his purposes</li>
            <li>The priest who should mediate between God and people instead blocks access to God's word—a reversal of priestly calling</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>⚖️ Judgment Patterns</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The oracle against Amaziah demonstrates poetic justice: the one who tried to exile the prophet will himself die in exile</li>
            <li>His family will suffer the very fate he wanted silenced—prophetic words cannot be suppressed, only delayed</li>
            <li>Personal opposition to God's messenger brings personal judgment—a pattern seen throughout Scripture</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-highlight" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        <h4>✨ Redemption Through Prophetic Witness</h4>
        <p>Despite Amaziah's opposition, the prophetic word endures. His attempt to silence Amos failed—we still read Amos's message 2,800 years later. The confrontation itself became part of Scripture, warning every generation about the danger of opposing God's word while bearing God's name.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The prophetic tradition survives institutional opposition—truth is resilient</li>
          <li>Amaziah's failure to silence Amos demonstrates God's sovereignty over His word</li>
          <li>The preserved narrative serves as perpetual warning against religious leaders who serve power rather than truth</li>
        </ul>

         SECTION 7: MESSIANIC
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="messianic">
      <h3>Messianic Trajectory & Christ Connections</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Pattern of Religious Opposition:</strong>
          Amaziah's opposition to Amos establishes a pattern that reaches its climax in the religious leaders' opposition to Jesus. The charge of political sedition ("He says he is a king!"), the attempt to silence through expulsion, the distortion of words—all reappear in the Gospels.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>The True Priest:</strong>
          Amaziah was a priest who served idolatry and opposed God's word. Christ is the faithful High Priest who perfectly mediates between God and humanity, who speaks only what the Father gives Him, and who never compromises truth for political advantage.
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <strong>Prophetic Authority:</strong>
          Amaziah questioned Amos's authority to speak at Bethel. The religious leaders questioned Jesus's authority to teach in the temple. In both cases, authority came not from institutional recognition but from divine commission—"the LORD took me... the LORD said to me."
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Christological Significance:</strong> Amaziah represents the religious establishment that would later crucify Christ. His accusation to Jeroboam ("Amos has conspired against you") foreshadows the accusation to Pilate ("He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah, a king"). The pattern of corrupted religion opposing divine truth reaches its zenith—and its defeat—at the cross.

      <h3>Application & Contemporary Relevance</h3>
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>🙏 Personal Application</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hearing Uncomfortable Truth:</strong> How do we respond when God's word challenges our comfort, interests, or assumptions? Do we engage or dismiss?</li>
            <li><strong>Conflating Interests:</strong> Where might we confuse our own preferences or cultural values with divine will?</li>
            <li><strong>Name vs. Reality:</strong> Amaziah bore Yahweh's name while opposing Yahweh's word—do our lives match our confession?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>⛪ Community Application</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Institutional Faithfulness:</strong> Churches can prioritize institutional survival over prophetic witness—Amaziah's temptation is perennial</li>
            <li><strong>Welcoming Prophetic Voices:</strong> Do our communities create space for uncomfortable truth, or do we silence what disturbs us?</li>
            <li><strong>Religion & Politics:</strong> The conflation of national interest and divine will corrupts both faith and politics—Amaziah warns against it</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-insight" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        <strong>Contemporary Challenge:</strong> Amaziah's instinct was to protect the institution by silencing the prophet. This temptation recurs whenever religious communities face uncomfortable truths about justice, ethics, or complicity with injustice. The question remains: Do we serve the "king's sanctuary" or the LORD's word?

         SECTION 9: STUDY QUESTIONS
         ========================================== -->
    <div class="theology-card animate-on-scroll" id="questions">
      <h3>Study Questions</h3>
      <ol class="question-list">
        <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Compare Amos 7:9 with Amaziah's report in 7:11. How does Amaziah misquote Amos, and what does this reveal about his character?</li>
        <li><strong>Literary:</strong> What does Amaziah's language about Bethel ("king's sanctuary," "temple of the kingdom") reveal about his understanding of religion's purpose?</li>
        <li><strong>Theological:</strong> Why does Amos respond to Amaziah's dismissal with his testimony of divine calling (7:14–15)? What does this reveal about the source of prophetic authority?</li>
        <li><strong>Application:</strong> In what ways might contemporary religious institutions face the same temptation as Amaziah—protecting institutional interests at the expense of prophetic truth?</li>
        <li><strong>Connections:</strong> How does the Amaziah-Amos confrontation foreshadow the religious leaders' opposition to Jesus?</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="discussion-prompt">
        <h4>Small Group Discussion</h4>
        <p>Consider discussing: Amaziah's accusation assumed Amos was prophesying for money. What assumptions do we make about people whose message challenges our comfort? How do these assumptions function to dismiss truth?</p>
