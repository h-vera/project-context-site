    <h2>About the Scroll Edition</h2>
    <p><em>This scroll edition formats The BibleProject's literal literary translation for immersive, continuous reading.</em></p>
    <p>This edition presents Paul's letter to the Ephesians as <strong>continuous, unbroken text</strong>—the way it would have been experienced when first read aloud to the assembly at Ephesus. There are no chapter divisions, no verse numbers, no section headings. Just the letter, flowing from opening to close.</p>
    <p>The <strong>indentation and spacing</strong> remain to show the literary structure—parallelisms, expansions, doxologies, and rhetorical flow—but all visual markers (colors, labels) have been removed. This is for <strong>immersive reading, oral performance, or contemplative study</strong> of the letter as a unified whole.</p>
    <p>Read it slowly. Read it aloud. Let the rhythm and cadence guide you through Paul's vision of cosmic reconciliation and the mystery of the Messiah.</p>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Therefore remember that at one time y'all, the gentiles in flesh,</div>

  <div class="l i1">by what is called "the circumcised"</div>
  <div class="l i2">(what is performed by hands in the flesh),</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">But now, through/in Messiah Jesus,</div>
  <div class="l i1">y'all who at one time were far away</div>
  <div class="l i1">have become near</div>

  <div class="l">having set aside the Torah of commandments in decrees,</div>

  <div class="l i3">making peace,</div>

  <div class="l">Therefore I say and testify by the Lord,</div>

</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">having been in the dark in their mindset,</div>
  <div class="l i1">estranged from the life of God</div>
  <div class="l i2">because of the ignorance which is in them</div>
  <div class="l i3">on account of the hardness of their heart,</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">who, after making themselves calloused,</div>
  <div class="l i1">gave themselves over to a lack of self-control</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">But you did not learn the Messiah in a way such,</div>

  <div class="l">that y'all are to take off the old humanity</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</div>

  <div class="l">and to put on the new humanity</div>
  <div class="l i1">which has been created in accordance with God</div>
  <div class="l i2">in justice and true piety.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Therefore, having put off the lie,</div>
  <div class="l i1">"speak truth, each one with his neighbor,"</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">"Be angry and do not sin."</div>
  <div class="l i1">Do not let the sun set on your anger,</div>

</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">The one who steals, let him no longer steal,</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Any rotten word, don't let it come out of y'all's mouth,</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">But be kind to one another, compassionate,</div>

  <div class="l">Therefore, become imitators of God</div>

  <div class="l i1">and gave himself as an offering and a sacrifice to God</div>

</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">But sexual immorality and all impurity or greedy desire</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">also obscenity or foolish talk or inappropriate humor,</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">For y'all should know surely this:</div>

</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Let no one deceive you with empty words,</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Therefore, do not participate together with them.</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">For you (now you are light in the Lord)</div>
  <div class="l i1">were darkness at one time.</div>

  <div class="l">And don't share together in the fruitless deeds of darkness,</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">For what is done by them in hiding is even shameful to mention,</div>

  <div class="l i1">Therefore one says:</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">And don't be drunk with wine,</div>

  <div class="l">"For this reason a man will leave the father and mother</div>
