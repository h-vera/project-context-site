    <h2>About the Scroll Edition</h2>
    <p>This edition presents Paul's letter to Timothy as <strong>continuous, unbroken text</strong>—the way it would have been experienced when first read aloud to the assembly at Ephesus. There are no chapter divisions, no verse numbers, no section headings. Just the letter, flowing from opening to close.</p>
    <p>The <strong>indentation and spacing</strong> remain to show the literary structure—triads, lists, credal statements, and rhetorical flow—but all visual markers (colors, labels) have been removed. This is for <strong>immersive reading, oral performance, or contemplative study</strong> of the letter as a unified whole.</p>
    <p>Read it slowly. Read it aloud. Let the rhythm and cadence guide you through Paul's pastoral wisdom to his beloved son in the faith.</p>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus</div>
  <div class="l i1">by the command of God our Savior</div>
  <div class="l i1">and Christ Jesus our hope,</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">to Timothy, my genuine child in faith—</div>
  <div class="l i1">grace, mercy, and peace</div>
  <div class="l i1">from God the Father</div>
  <div class="l i1">and Christ Jesus our Lord.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Just as I urged you to remain in Ephesus when I went to Macedonia,</div>
  <div class="l">that you might charge certain persons not to teach different doctrine,</div>
  <div class="l i1">nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies</div>
  <div class="l i1">which give rise to controversies</div>
  <div class="l i1">rather than God's stewardship that is by faith.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l"><span class="sc">The goal of the charge is love—</span></div>
  <div class="l i1">from a pure heart,</div>
  <div class="l i2">and a good conscience,</div>
  <div class="l i3">and a sincere faith.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Some have missed this mark</div>
  <div class="l i1">and have turned aside to empty talk,</div>
  <div class="l">desiring to be teachers of the Law</div>
  <div class="l i1">though they understand neither what they are saying</div>
  <div class="l i1">nor the things about which they make confident claims.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Now we know that the Law is good,</div>
  <div class="l i1">if one uses it lawfully,</div>
  <div class="l">understanding that the Law is not laid down for the righteous,</div>
  <div class="l i1">but for the lawless and rebellious,</div>
  <div class="l i1">for the ungodly and sinners,</div>
  <div class="l i1">for the unholy and the profane,</div>
  <div class="l i1">for father-killers and mother-killers,</div>
  <div class="l i1">for murderers,</div>
  <div class="l i1">for the sexually immoral,</div>
  <div class="l i1">for men who lie with men,</div>
  <div class="l i1">for enslavers,</div>
  <div class="l i1">for liars,</div>
  <div class="l i1">and for perjurers,</div>
  <div class="l">and for whatever else stands opposed to healthy doctrine,</div>
  <div class="l i1">in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God,</div>
  <div class="l i1">with which I was entrusted.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">I thank Christ Jesus our Lord,</div>
  <div class="l i1">who strengthened me,</div>
  <div class="l i1">because he judged me faithful,</div>
  <div class="l i1">setting me into service,</div>
  <div class="l">even though I was formerly a blasphemer,</div>
  <div class="l i1">a persecutor,</div>
  <div class="l i1">and a violent man.</div>
  <div class="l">Yet I was shown mercy,</div>
  <div class="l i1">because I acted ignorantly in unbelief,</div>
  <div class="l">and the grace of our Lord overflowed abundantly</div>
  <div class="l i1">with faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l"><span class="sc">Faithful is the saying,</span></div>
  <div class="l i1"><span class="sc">and worthy of full acceptance:</span></div>
  <div class="l i2">Christ Jesus came into the world</div>
  <div class="l i2">to rescue and restore sinners—</div>
  <div class="l i2">of whom I am the foremost.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">But for this reason I received mercy,</div>
  <div class="l i1">that in me, the foremost,</div>
  <div class="l i1">Christ Jesus might display all his patience,</div>
  <div class="l i1">as an example for those who would believe in him</div>
  <div class="l i2">for eternal life.</div>

<section class="block doxo-anchor">
  <div class="l"><strong>Now to the King of the ages,</strong></div>
  <div class="l i1"><strong>immortal, invisible,</strong></div>
  <div class="l i1"><strong>the only God—</strong></div>
  <div class="l"><strong>be honor and glory</strong></div>
  <div class="l i1"><strong>forever and ever. Amen.</strong></div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">This charge I entrust to you, my child Timothy,</div>
  <div class="l i1">in keeping with the prophecies once spoken about you,</div>
  <div class="l i1">that by them you may wage the good warfare,</div>
  <div class="l">holding faith and a good conscience,</div>
  <div class="l i1">which some, having thrust away,</div>
  <div class="l i1">have suffered shipwreck regarding the faith.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander,</div>
  <div class="l i1">whom I have handed over to Satan,</div>
  <div class="l i2">to let the consequences teach them</div>
  <div class="l i3">not to blaspheme.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">I urge, therefore, first of all,</div>
  <div class="l i1">that entreaties,</div>
  <div class="l i1">prayers,</div>
  <div class="l i1">petitions,</div>
  <div class="l i1">and thanksgivings</div>
  <div class="l">be made on behalf of all people—</div>
  <div class="l i1">for kings and all who are in positions of eminence—</div>
  <div class="l">in order that we might lead a tranquil and quiet life,</div>
  <div class="l i1">in all godliness and dignity.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">This is good</div>
  <div class="l i1">and acceptable before God our Savior,</div>
  <div class="l i1">who wills all people to be rescued</div>
  <div class="l i2">and brought into recognition of the truth.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">For one is God,</div>
  <div class="l i1">and one also mediator between God and humankind—</div>
  <div class="l i2">a human, Christ Jesus—</div>
  <div class="l i2">who gave himself a ransom on behalf of all,</div>
  <div class="l i3">the testimony in its own times.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">For this I was set as herald and apostle—</div>
  <div class="l i1">I speak truth, I do not lie—</div>
  <div class="l i1">teacher of the nations,</div>
  <div class="l i2">in faith and truth.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Therefore I intend the men to pray in every place,</div>
  <div class="l i1">lifting holy hands</div>
  <div class="l i1">without anger or dispute.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Likewise, women should adorn themselves in respectable attire,</div>
  <div class="l i1">with reverent restraint and sound judgment—</div>
  <div class="l i1">not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments,</div>
  <div class="l i1">but with what is fitting for women who profess reverence for God—</div>
  <div class="l i2">through good works.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Let a woman learn in quietness,</div>
  <div class="l i1">in all submission.</div>
  <div class="l">But I do not permit a woman to teach</div>
  <div class="l i1">or to exercise authority over a man;</div>
  <div class="l">rather, she is to remain in quietness.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">For Adam was formed first,</div>
  <div class="l i1">then Eve.</div>
  <div class="l">And Adam was not deceived,</div>
  <div class="l i1">but the woman, having been deceived,</div>
  <div class="l i2">has come to be in transgression.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Yet she will be saved through <i>the</i> childbearing—</div>

  <div class="l i2">with sound judgment.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l"><span class="smallcaps">Trustworthy is the saying:</span></div>
  <div class="l i1">If anyone aspires to oversight, he desires a noble work.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Therefore, it is necessary for the one who watches over to be blameless—</div>
  <div class="l i1">a man of one woman, well-disciplined, sound in mind, friend to strangers,</div>
  <div class="l i1">able to teach;</div>
  <div class="l i1">not beside wine, not violent but gentle, peaceable,</div>
  <div class="l i1">not a lover of money.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">The one standing before his own household well,</div>
  <div class="l i1">having children in submission with all dignity.</div>
  <div class="l">But if anyone does not know how to stand before his own household,</div>
  <div class="l i1">how will he care for God's assembly?</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Not newly planted, in order that having been filled with smoke,</div>
  <div class="l i1">he might not fall into the judgment of the accuser.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">But it is also necessary to have a good testimony from those outside,</div>
  <div class="l i1">in order that he might not fall into reproach and a snare of the accuser.</div>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">Those who serve likewise must be dignified,</div>
  <div class="l i1">not double-tongued, not given to much wine,</div>

  <div class="l">holding the mystery of the faith</div>

  <div class="l">Those who serve must be men of one woman,</div>

<section class="block">
  <div class="l">For those who have served well</div>
  <div class="l i1">acquire for themselves a good standing</div>

  <div class="l i3">the pillar and base of the truth.</div>

  <div class="l"><strong><span class="sc">And, in a manner confessed by all,</span></strong></div>
