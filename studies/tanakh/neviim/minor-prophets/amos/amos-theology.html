      Theological Themes
      <span class="hebrew-large">עָמוֹס</span>
    </h2>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="theology-intro">
      <p>The Book of Amos is not merely an ancient document about a past judgment—it's a living word that exposes the perennial human tendency to divorce worship from ethics, privilege from responsibility, and blessing from justice.</p>
      <p>Amos's theological vision centers on a God who demands that covenant relationship transform every aspect of life—especially how the powerful treat the powerless. These themes remain devastatingly relevant for faith communities today.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Theme 1: Justice & Righteousness -->
    <div class="theme-section">
      <div class="theme-header">
        <span class="theme-icon-large">⚖️</span>
        <div>
          <h3>Justice & Righteousness</h3>
          <p>The inseparable heart of covenant faithfulness</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-verse-callout">
        "But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream."
        <span class="reference">— Amos 5:24</span>
      </div>

      <p>This verse—perhaps the most famous in the entire book—captures Amos's central demand. Justice (מִשְׁפָּט, mishpat) and righteousness (צְדָקָה, tsedaqah) are not optional additions to worship but its very essence.</p>

      <div class="theme-content-grid">
        <div class="theme-panel">
          <h4>What Mishpat Means</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Concrete actions to correct injustice</li>
            <li>Fair legal verdicts at the city gate</li>
            <li>Interventions that protect the vulnerable</li>
            <li>Systemic practices that create equity</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="theme-panel">
          <h4>What Tsedaqah Means</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Right relationships across social boundaries</li>
            <li>The quality of equitable community</li>
            <li>Character that naturally produces justice</li>
            <li>Covenant faithfulness made visible</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="contrast-box">
        <div class="contrast-side negative">
          <h4>❌ Israel's Reality</h4>
          <p>Justice turned to wormwood (5:7)<br>
          Righteousness cast to the ground<br>
          The poor sold for silver (2:6)<br>
          Trampling the heads of the needy (2:7)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="contrast-vs">VS</div>
        <div class="contrast-side positive">
          <h4>✓ God's Demand</h4>
          <p>Justice rolling like waters (5:24)<br>
          Righteousness like unfailing stream<br>
          Establish justice in the gate (5:15)<br>
          Seek good, that you may live (5:14)</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>The River Metaphor:</strong> Why waters and streams? A wadi in Israel is usually dry, but when rain comes, it becomes a rushing torrent. Amos envisions justice and righteousness not as occasional acts of charity but as a constant, powerful, life-giving flood that fills every dry channel of society.
      </div>

      <div class="application-box">
        <h4>🔍 Contemporary Application</h4>
        <p>Amos challenges any community that separates "spiritual" activities (worship, prayer, Bible study) from "social" activities (caring for the marginalized, advocating for the oppressed). For Amos, these are not separate categories—genuine worship necessarily produces justice, and injustice renders worship worthless.</p>
        <p><strong>Questions to consider:</strong> Does our worship community's treatment of the vulnerable reflect our worship? Would Amos recognize our justice as a "river" or a "dry bed"?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Theme 2: Religious Hypocrisy -->
    <div class="theme-section">
      <div class="theme-header">
        <span class="theme-icon-large">🎭</span>
        <div>
          <h3>Religious Hypocrisy</h3>
          <p>Worship divorced from ethics is worse than no worship</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-verse-callout">
        "I hate, I despise your festivals, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies. Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them... Take away from me the noise of your songs; to the melody of your harps I will not listen."
        <span class="reference">— Amos 5:21-23</span>
      </div>

      <p>These are among the harshest words God speaks in Scripture about religious activity. Israel's worship was abundant—festivals, assemblies, offerings, songs—but it was disconnected from covenant living. God calls it "noise."</p>

      <div class="theme-content-grid">
        <div class="theme-panel">
          <h4>The Problem Exposed</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Faithful attendance at religious gatherings</li>
            <li>Generous offerings and sacrifices</li>
            <li>Elaborate worship music</li>
            <li>Multiple sacred sites (Bethel, Gilgal)</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><em>All while...</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Selling the poor into debt slavery</li>
            <li>Denying legal representation to the needy</li>
            <li>Building luxury on exploitation</li>
            <li>Perverting justice at the gate</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="theme-panel">
          <h4>Why God Rejects It</h4>
          <p>For Amos, worship and ethics are inseparable. You cannot claim relationship with the God who rescued slaves from Egypt while enslaving your own poor. You cannot praise the God of justice while perverting justice.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The worship itself becomes offensive—not because the forms are wrong, but because they're disconnected from transformed living. It's "a sham" (as the Bible Project summarizes).</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Sarcastic Invitation:</strong> Amos sarcastically invites Israel: "Come to Bethel—and transgress; to Gilgal—and multiply transgression" (4:4). He's mocking their religious activities as occasions for sin rather than faithfulness. Every visit to the sanctuary deepens their guilt.
      </div>

      <div class="application-box">
        <h4>🔍 Contemporary Application</h4>
        <p>Amos confronts any religious community that maintains vibrant worship while tolerating injustice—whether economic exploitation, racial discrimination, abuse of the vulnerable, or complicity in systemic oppression. The warning is sharp: God may hate our worship too.</p>
        <p><strong>The test:</strong> Does our worship make us more generous, more just, more attentive to the marginalized? If not, we may be adding to our guilt rather than expressing faith.</p>

    <!-- Theme: Humans Becoming Beasts -->
<div class="theme-section">
  <div class="theme-header">
    <span class="theme-icon-large">🦁</span>
    <div>
      <h3>Humans Becoming Beasts</h3>
      <p>When humans reject God's rule, they become less than human</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="key-verse-callout">
    "For three transgressions... and for four, I will not revoke the punishment."
    <span class="reference">— Amos 1:3 (repeated formula)</span>
  </div>

  <p>One of Genesis 1's core visions is humans ruling <em>over</em> the animals in peaceful coexistence—caring for creation as God's representatives. But when humans reject God's wisdom and define good and evil on their own terms, they don't become more powerful; they become <em>less than human</em>. They start acting like predatory beasts.</p>

  <div class="theme-content-grid">
    <div class="theme-panel">
      <h4>The Genesis Pattern</h4>
      <p>In Genesis 3, a beast (the serpent) deceives humans into rebellion. In Genesis 4, Cain is warned that sin is "crouching" like a predator—and when he gives in, he acts like an animal, killing his brother. This pattern escalates through Genesis, culminating in violent empires founded by Nimrod, "a mighty hunter" and "mighty warrior"—a beast-slayer and man-slayer who built Babylon.</p>
      <p>The trajectory is clear: humans who reject God's wisdom don't transcend their limitations—they descend below them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="theme-panel">
      <h4>Amos's Application</h4>
      <p>Amos depicts the nations—including Israel—as acting like predatory animals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Damascus:</strong> "threshed Gilead with sledges" (1:3)</li>
        <li><strong>Gaza/Tyre:</strong> Slave trading—treating humans as prey (1:6, 9)</li>
        <li><strong>Ammon:</strong> Atrocities against pregnant women (1:13)</li>
        <li><strong>Israel:</strong> "Trampling the heads of the poor" (2:7)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These aren't merely crimes—they're portraits of humans who have forfeited their humanity and become beasts.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="contrast-box">
    <div class="contrast-side negative">
      <h4>❌ Beastly Rule</h4>
      <p>Territorial<br>
      Zero-sum (my flourishing requires your death)<br>
      Violence as power<br>
      Short-sighted self-interest<br>
      Treating others as prey</p>
    </div>
    <div class="contrast-vs">VS</div>
    <div class="contrast-side positive">
      <h4>✓ Divine Rule</h4>
      <p>Generous<br>
      Non-zero-sum (we flourish together)<br>
      Service as authority<br>
      Long-term covenant faithfulness<br>
      Protecting the vulnerable</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="key-insight">
    <strong>The "Cows of Bashan" (4:1):</strong> Amos's famous insult calls the wealthy women of Samaria "cows of Bashan"—prized cattle from a fertile region. But this isn't just an insult about luxury or laziness. It's a theological statement: these people, who were called to rule as God's image-bearers, have become livestock. They've traded their humanity for comfort built on oppression. They are no longer qualified to sit on the throne beside God.
  </div>

  <div class="application-box">
    <h4>🔍 Connection to Daniel 7</h4>
    <p>Daniel 7's vision of beast-kingdoms trampling the earth isn't random imagery—it's the culmination of this Genesis-to-Amos trajectory. The empires that oppress God's people are depicted as mutant beasts precisely because they represent humans who have become less than human through violence and injustice.</p>
    <p>The "one like a son of man" who receives the kingdom is the answer to this problem: a truly human one who rules the way humans were always meant to rule—not by devouring others, but by serving them.</p>
  </div>
</div>

    <!-- Theme 3: Election & Responsibility -->
    <div class="theme-section">
      <div class="theme-header">
        <span class="theme-icon-large">👑</span>
        <div>
          <h3>Election & Responsibility</h3>
          <p>Privilege brings accountability, not immunity</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="key-verse-callout">
        "You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities."
        <span class="reference">— Amos 3:2</span>
      </div>

      <p>This verse reverses Israel's assumptions. They believed their election meant protection—God would never judge His chosen people. Amos announces that election means the <em>opposite</em>: greater privilege brings greater accountability.</p>

      <div class="theme-content-grid">
        <div class="theme-panel">
          <h4>Israel's False Assumption</h4>
          <p>"We are God's chosen people. He brought us out of Egypt. He gave us this land. We have the temple, the sacrifices, the festivals. Therefore we are safe from judgment—the Day of the LORD will vindicate us against our enemies."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="theme-panel">
          <h4>Amos's Devastating Correction</h4>
          <p>"Precisely <em>because</em> you were chosen, you will be judged more severely. You received greater light; you bear greater responsibility. Your election was for mission—to be a blessing to all nations—not for privilege without accountability."</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The logic is unmistakable: <strong>Great calling + Great responsibility = Great consequences.</strong></p>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>The Exodus Memory:</strong> Amos specifically invokes the Exodus: "I brought you up out of the land of Egypt" (2:10; 3:1). Israel, of all peoples, should know what oppression feels like. Their treatment of the poor is a betrayal of their own identity as redeemed slaves.

      <div class="application-box">
        <h4>🔍 Contemporary Application</h4>
        <p>Any community that claims special relationship with God—whether church, nation, or institution—must reckon with Amos's principle. Spiritual privilege does not grant immunity from judgment; it intensifies accountability. Those who have received much will be judged by how much they gave.</p>
        <p><strong>The question:</strong> Has our "chosen" status made us humble servants or entitled consumers of divine favor?</p>

        <span class="reference">— Amos 5:18-19</span>
      </div>

      <p>Israel eagerly anticipated "the day of the LORD"—expecting it to be their vindication against enemies. Amos shatters this expectation. For unfaithful Israel, that day will be judgment, not salvation.</p>

      <p>The imagery of fleeing from lion to bear to snake is devastating—there's no escape. Every apparent refuge leads to another danger. The Day of the LORD will be inescapable judgment.</p>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Fulfilled in 722 BCE:</strong> Approximately 40 years after Amos prophesied, the Assyrian Empire conquered Samaria and exiled the Northern Kingdom. The "Day of the LORD" came exactly as Amos predicted—not as vindication but as devastating judgment.

      <div class="application-box">
        <h4>🔍 Contemporary Application</h4>
        <p>Amos warns against assuming divine favor based on religious identity. The Day of the LORD will reveal truth, not confirm comfortable assumptions. Those who expect vindication may find judgment; those who humble themselves under God's standards may find mercy.</p>
        <p><strong>The sobering word:</strong> Eagerly anticipating God's intervention is only appropriate if we're living in alignment with His values—especially justice for the vulnerable.</p>

      <p>Notice the parallel: "Seek <strong>me</strong>" (5:4) = "Seek <strong>good</strong>" (5:14). For Amos, these are not separate commands but two ways of saying the same thing. To truly seek God is to seek the good of others; to turn your back on God (through idolatry) is to live at the expense of others.</p>

        <strong>The Idolatry Connection:</strong> Why does worshiping other gods lead to injustice? Because those gods don't require the same ethical transformation as Yahweh. The Canaanite fertility gods demanded ritual, not righteousness. When you worship a god who doesn't care about justice, you won't care either.

      <p>After eight chapters of relentless judgment, the book closes with unexpected hope. God will restore what has fallen—not with triumphalist language about a palace, but with humble imagery of a "booth" (sukkah), a fragile shelter.</p>

      <div class="key-insight">
        <strong>Justice and Mercy Meet:</strong> The structure of Amos reveals the relationship between God's justice and mercy. If God is good, He must confront evil among Israel and the nations. But His long-term purposes are for restoration and a new covenant family. Both are essential to who God is.

        <p>James quotes Amos 9:11-12 at the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15:16-17) to argue that Gentiles should be included in God's people without becoming Jews first. The "booth of David" raised up in Christ welcomes people from all nations—exactly as Amos promised.</p>

        <strong>The Combined Message:</strong> True relationship with God transforms both worship (Hosea) and ethics (Amos). You cannot separate devotion from justice. Idolatry leads to injustice; injustice reveals idolatry. To seek God is to seek the good of others. Together, these prophets show that covenant faithfulness is comprehensive—it touches every dimension of life.
