            God tells Israel to mark their doorways with the blood of a lamb. When the Lord sees the blood, He “passes over”

      <!-- 2. Big Idea -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2><span>2.</span> Big Idea: God Provides the Way Out</h2>
        <p>
          Passover and the Lord’s Supper are both about <strong>life coming through death</strong> and
          <strong>freedom coming through sacrifice</strong>. The Exodus story is a <em>road</em>:
          the way <strong>out</strong> of slavery, the way <strong>through</strong> the wilderness, and the way
          <strong>into</strong> the land of blessing. Jesus steps into that story as the new and greater Moses—
          and even more, as God himself coming to lead a new Exodus.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In Exodus, God breaks Israel’s chains and leads them out of Egypt—they couldn’t free themselves.</li>
          <li>At the cross, Jesus calls his own death an <strong>Exodus</strong> and becomes our Passover Lamb, 
              opening a <strong>way through death</strong> into new creation life.</li>
          <li>We still fight “slavery” today – to habits, fears, addictions, people’s approval, or anything that owns our hearts.</li>
          <li>God doesn’t just forgive the past; He walks with us in the present, teaching us to live as free sons and daughters.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="teen-note">
          <strong>For teens (and parents!)</strong><br />
          Jesus doesn’t just ask you to “try harder.” He invites you to trust His sacrifice,
          bring Him the things that feel too strong for you, and walk with Him into real freedom.
        </div>

      <!-- 3. Share Around the Table -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2><span>3.</span> Share Around the Table <span class="pill">Family Sharing</span></h2>
        <p>
          Go around and let each parent and teen share. You don’t have to be super deep or perfect –
          just honest and respectful. Listen well to each other.
        </p>

        <h3>Take turns answering one or two of these:</h3>
        <ul class="question-list">
          <li>
            What is <strong>one thing God has already freed me from</strong> in my life – or something I’m asking Him to free me from?
          </li>
          <li>
            Where have I seen God’s <strong>provision</strong> this year – something I know I couldn’t have pulled off alone?
          </li>
          <li>
            What is <strong>one “Egypt” or “slave-driver”</strong> in my life right now (pressure, fear, sin, or distraction)
            that I want to bring into the light with God and with my family?
          </li>
          <li>
            Share <strong>one word or short sentence of thanks</strong> to Jesus for His sacrifice tonight.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="muted">
          💡 Option: after sharing, each person can say a short prayer like,
          “Lord, thank you for freeing me from ______. Help me trust you more.”
        </p>

      <!-- 4. Simple Closing Prayer -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2><span>4.</span> Simple Closing Prayer</h2>
        <p>
          You can have one person pray this for everyone, or different people read one line each:
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:6px;">
          “God of Exodus and God of the cross, thank You for passing over our sin because of Jesus’ blood.
          Thank You for doing what we could never do on our own. Tonight we remember the Lamb who was slain
          so we could live. Please show us where we are still enslaved, and gently lead us out. Teach us to walk
          as free sons and daughters, full of gratitude, love, and courage. In Jesus’ name, amen.”
        </p>
      </section>

      <p class="footer-note">
        “For Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed.” — 1 Corinthians 5:7<br />
        To follow Jesus is to walk in <strong>The Way</strong>—the road out of slavery, through the wilderness,
        and toward God’s new creation life together.
